\textbf{As you read the following excerpt from Kris Shaffer's \emph{Open Music
Theory}, try to find the value in developing a basic understanding of
counterpoint in a tonal harmony--two very different styles of composition. We
will only discuss strict counterpoint briefly, but it can provide a good deal
of insight into our studies.}

\hypertarget{class-reading-from-open-music-theory}{%
\chapter{\texorpdfstring{Class reading from \emph{Open Music
Theory}}{Class reading from Open Music Theory}}\label{class-reading-from-open-music-theory}}

The study of the theory of Western music involves three main components:
voice-leading, harmony, and form. \emph{Voice-leading} deals with the
relationship of two or more musical lines (or melodies) combined into a single
musical idea. \emph{Harmony} addresses the rules or norms for combining chords
into successions. \emph{Form} addresses the rules or norms for the combination
of phrases and other small musical units into larger units---including whole
movements and works.

We will address all three of these facets of musical theory. However, of the
three, voice-leading is the most fundamental. Thus, we begin our study of
music theory, then, with \emph{strict voice-leading}, or \emph{counterpoint}.

Twentieth-century musician and theorist, Heinrich Schenker, wrote:

\begin{quote}
The purpose of counterpoint, rather than to teach a specific style of
composition, is to lead the ear of the serious student of music for the first
time into the infinite world of fundamental musical problems
(\emph{Kontrapunkt}, p.~10).
\end{quote}

Following this line of thinking, our early voice-leading exercises will not be
in a specific style (Classical, Baroque, Romantic, pop/rock, etc.). Instead,
these exercises will eliminate important musical elements like \emph{harmony},
\emph{orchestration}, \emph{melodic motives}, \emph{formal structure}, and
even many elements of \emph{rhythm}, in order to focus very specifically on a
small set of musical problems. These other elements of music will be
introduced one-by-one as we progress through this course and into future
courses.

The ``fundamental musical problems'' we will address in the study of
counterpoint center around the way in which some basic principles of auditory
perception and cognition (how the brain perceives and conceptualizes sound)
play out in Western musical structure. For example, our brains tend to assume
that sounds similar in pitch or timbre come from the same source. Our brains
also listen for patterns, and when a new sound continues or completes a
previously heard pattern, it assumes that the new sound belongs together with
those others. On the other hand, the breaking of these regularities in the
sonic environment can signal danger, or at the very least the need for
heightened attention to be applied to the sonic ``culprit.'' Identifying
irregularities in the sonic environment and boosting attention and adrenaline
when one is found have been absolutely essential to the survival of the human
species. These abilities are also what allows music to have the emotional
effect that it does on so many people. Whether or not a composer or songwriter
is aware of the science and psychology of hearing, a masterful composer
mediates and plays with these basic concepts.

``Mediates'' and ``plays'' are important ideas here. Music that simply makes
it easy for the brain to parse and process sound is boring. It calls for no
heightened attention -- it doesn't increase our heart rate or make the hair on
the back of our neck stand up or give us a little jolt of dopamine. On the
other hand, music that constantly activates our innate sense of danger is
hardly pleasant for most listeners. Thus, fundamental to most of the music we
will study is the dance between tension and relaxation, motion and rest.

The study of counterpoint will help us to engage several important musical
``problems'' in a limited context, so that we can master them compositionally
and understand them analytically. Those problems arise as we seek to bring the
following traits together:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  smoothness\\
\item
  independence and integrity of melodic lines\\
\item
  tonal fusion (the preference for simultaneous notes to form a consonant
  unity)\\
\item
  variety\\
\item
  motion (towards a goal)
\end{itemize}

These traits are based in human perception and cognition, but they are often
in conflict in specific musical moments, and need to be balanced over the
course of larger passages and complete works. Counterpoint will help us begin
to practice mediating these conflicts.

Also, note Schenker's expression ``lead the ear.'' Counterpoint is not a
pencil-and-paper (or lecture-and-homework) study. Rather, the exercises are
mini- (micro-? nano-?) compositions that must be \emph{performed}---with voice
and/or keyboard, often with a partner---so that the ear, the fingers, the
throat, and ultimately the mind can internalize the sound, sight, and feel of
good (and bad) musical lines, and good (and bad) combinations of musical
lines.

The specific method we will use is called \emph{species counterpoint}---so
called because the study progresses through stages, or species, where one or
two new musical ``problems'' are introduced. This approach has existed in some
form since the early seventeenth century. The specific method we will use is
very close to that articulated by Johann Joseph Fux, in his \emph{Gradus ad
parnassum} (\emph{Steps to Parnassus}, 1725). Master composers from the
eighteenth to the twenty-first centuries have used this method, or some
variation on it. While Fux proposed five species, moving from two-voice
combinations up to six- and eight-voice combinations, we will focus on species
one through four, in two voices only.

\hypertarget{conclusions}{%
\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

Any lesson could begin with the question, ``Why study this it all?'' and the
discussion of counterpoint is no different. Why should we study counterpoint
in a tonal harmony class when there are entire courses in later semesters
dedicated to this specific subject?

First, you should try to conceptualize what counterpoint is in a musical
context. Notice the second sentence of the passage above:

\begin{quote}
``\emph{Voice-leading} deals with the relationship of two or more musical
lines (or melodies) combined into a single musical idea.''
\end{quote}

And then, from the second paragraph:

\begin{quote}
However, of the three {[}aspects of music{]}, voice-leading is the most
fundamental. Thus, we begin our study of music theory, then, with \emph{strict
voice-leading}, or \emph{counterpoint}.
\end{quote}

A brief study of counterpoint is the next step as we work through increasing
levels of musical complexity. We began with a single pitch, then combined
pitches to create intervals. We then combine intervals to create melodies and
combine melodies to create counterpoint. Studying counterpoint allows us to
strip away many of the complicating factors of musical harmony and begin to
understand the origin of tonality.

In the next topic, we will establish some basic rules for constructing a
simple melody and then look at what happens when we create a second melody
that works with the original. It is from these interactions that harmony
evolved as we know it, so to study counterpoint is to study the fundamental of
Western music.

Eighteenth century species counterpoint gives us a relatively straightforward
set of rules and norms to begin this study. Even though many of these rules
are not observed by modern music, we can study the process of how these rules
create music and then apply that \emph{process} to all types of music.

Finally, consider these two further takeaways from the reading: - Music is a
built upon tension and release. - Music is structured to create expectations
for the listener and then either fulfill or deny those expectations.

These observations consider the nature of musical composition in general,
because they also demonstrate the fundamentals of counterpoint. Tension,
release, and expectations are based on two primary functions: intervals and
melodic motion, and we will study these for the rest of this unit.

The concept of musical functions is foundational to musical analysis, and
essential to the understanding of musical styles.

A musical \emph{function} describes the role that a particular musical element
plays in the creation of a larger musical unit. Function is tied very much to
the idea of expectation: given a certain element in a certain context, what
element(s) is/are likely to come next? Likewise, how does a given element
fulfill or deny the expectations set by what came before it?

A musical function typically has two defining features: the characteristics of
the musical elements that tend to belong to that function (what notes tend to
be found in the chord, for example), and the kinds of elements (or functions)
that tend to precede or follow it in a succession of musical elements. Note
that this is entirely dependent on the typical patterns of a musical
\emph{style}. Different styles of music may exhibit different functions or
different behaviors for the same functions. The study of function and the
study of style are inextricably linked.

The two musical traits most commonly studied for their functional properties
in Western art and popular music are \emph{harmony} and \emph{form}. The study
of both harmonic functions and formal functions will lead to an understanding
of harmonic and formal \emph{syntax}: the norms or principles according to
which musical elements are combined into meaningful and stylistically
appropriate successions. The study of harmony or form, then, is not a matter
of learning to label chords, phrases, and modules correctly. It is a matter of
\emph{interpreting the role that chords, phrases, modules, etc. play in the
larger context in which they are found}. That, of course, requires fluency in
identifying (and thus labeling) individual musical elements. But
identification is only the beginning of a much bigger, and more interesting,
process of analysis. And it is that analytical work that will lead to true
understanding of the pieces of music analyzed, and the styles to which they
belong.

If a musical function describes the role that a particular musical element
plays in the creation of a larger musical unit, then \emph{a harmonic function
describes the role that a particular chord plays in the creating of a larger
harmonic progression}. Each chord tends to occur in some musical situations
more than others, to progress to some chords more than others. These
tendencies work together to create meaningful harmonic progressions, which can
in turn form the harmonic foundation for musical \emph{phrases},
\emph{themes}, and larger formal units.

Generally speaking, the function of a chord concerns the notes that belong to
it (its \emph{internal characteristics}), the chords that tend to precede and
follow it, and where it tends to be employed in the course of a musical
phrase.

A theory of harmonic functions is based on three fundamental principles:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Chords are collections of scale degrees.\\
\item
  Each scale degree has its own tendencies.\\
\item
  The collective tendencies of a chord's scale degrees in combination is the
  chord's function.
\end{itemize}

(Note the absence of \emph{root} and \emph{quality} from consideration here.)

Because \href{06-intro-harmonic/1-reading-styletendency.html}{tendency is
style-specific}, the same chord can have different functions in different
musical styles. For instance, the kinds of functions we find in classical
music are different from those we find in pop/rock songs from the Billboard
charts. And though there are some general harmonic traits that are common to
most eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Western composers (what we call the
``common practice''), when we look in closer detail, we find some significant
differences in the way Bach, Mozart, Brahms, and others compose their harmonic
progressions.

Our initial exploration of harmonic functions will engage the general ``common
practice'' that is shared by most eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Western
composers. As we explore specific genres, composers, and works within that
common practice, we will have opportunity to explore the more nuanced
differences between composers, as well as to move beyond common-practice
Western art music to include other styles, such as pop/rock.

In explaining musical styles,
\href{https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3267613W/Style_and_music}{Leonard Meyer}
divides musical characteristics into three categories: \emph{laws},
\emph{rules}, and \emph{strategies}. Laws are characteristics of music that
are based on human biology and psychology, and as a result laws are
more-or-less universal. Rules are culturally conditioned. They are hallmarks
of a particular style that are more-or-less universal within the style, but
differ from style to style and culture to culture. Finally, strategies are
specific ways in which composers work within a style---the things that make
one composer's work sound different from another's, even if they compose in
the same style.

For the most part, principles of voice-leading or harmonic progression are
``rules'' according to Meyer's definitions. They are specific to a style. Or,
in some cases, they are shared among a few styles of Western music, but are
far from universal. Thus, it can be helpful to think of them as collective
traits of some music(s) we seek to understand and emulate, rather than
hard-and-fast \emph{it-must-be-done-this-way} strictures for all musical
practice.

However, these rules are also related to laws, in as much as they represent
one set of practices that mediate the various demands on music from basic
principles of human auditory perception and cognition. For instance, the
prohibition against parallel fifths is a specific way in which Western tonal
composers have mediated the conflict between tonal fusion, goal-directed
motion, and independence of line. There are many other similar cases.

Note, however, that while ``avoid parallel fifths'' takes on the form of what
we consider ``rules'' in day-to-day speech, Meyer's rules of musical style are
different. Meyer's rules are \emph{descriptive}: these things tend to happen
universally, frequently, rarely, never, in specific situations. ``Avoid
parallel fifths'' is a \emph{prescriptive} instruction based on that
descriptive observation: because parallel fifths occur rarely in this style,
and only in specific cases, avoid them in your own strict-style compositions
until we have a chance to engage those specific cases --- all the while
remembering that other styles may have different tendencies.

That word \emph{tendencies} is an important one. There are rarely absolutes in
the musical parameters we engage most as performers, analysts, composers,
listeners, etc. The absolutes of common styles fell into our unconscious
background long ago. Instead, what makes each piece, composer, or style
special and unique --- what we care about --- are the little ways in which
they bend the ``rules,'' the ways in which they express, thwart, and play with
the tendencies of the style they engage --- the ways they play with our
expectations as listeners.

Over time, as we familiarize ourselves with a musical style, the tendencies of
the style become \emph{expectations} in our mind, and composers can, in turn,
compose with those listener expectations in mind. Though those tendencies are
subjective, and to a large extent statistical, the shared stylistic knowledge
and the shared psychological expectancy create a kind of quasi-objective
language. That musical ``language,'' like spoken/written languages, is both
reliable and bendable/breakable. The meaningfulness of a piece of music is
dependent on that reliability. But its specialness is dependent on the ability
for the ``rules'' of that language to be bent, even broken.

With this in mind, as we progress in our study of voice-leading, we will
encounter more exceptions to the prescriptive rules, even in strict-style
composition, and our hard-and-fast strictures will transition more and more
into the language of tendency.

\emph{Basso continuo} emerged in the seventeenth century as a shorthand
notation for keyboardists (typically church organists) who were accompanying a
soloist or small ensemble performing a work originally composed for a larger
group. For example, if two or three singers were tasked with performing an
eight-voice choral work, they could select the most prominent parts to sing,
while an organist could cover the rest. Performing five or six lines of
contrapuntal choral music could be a significant challenge, so organists
needed a way to condense the texture while still preserving the core musical
structure to support the vocalists.

The \emph{thorough bass} emerged as that shortcut. The ``thorough'' or
``continuous'' bass is a musical line that includes the lowest note at any
given time. Usually, works would not include a single part that could function
as this line, so the organist would alternate between voices, as they
exchanged registers or took rests. The resulting line, unlike the regular
``bass'' part, was ``continuous'' (or ``thorough'')---hence the name
\emph{thoroughbass} or \emph{basso continuo}.

A good musician could perform this bass line, and with an eye (or ear) on the
vocal parts and with knowledge of how to improvise good voice-leading, that
musician could \emph{accompany} the thoroughbass line with chords that made
musical sense. (This is the original meaning of the term accompany---to
accompany a bass line with chords. The fact that keyboardists did this in the
context of supporting a soloist or small ensemble led to that term later being
applied to any situation where a keyboardist \emph{accompanied} spotlight
performers.)

As this technique grew, publishers began publishing thoroughbass reductions of
large-ensemble pieces to support smaller groups of musicians. In these
publications, \emph{figures} (numbers above or below the bass line) were
included---sometimes only for difficult or non-standard chords, and eventually
for most chords, enabling more amateur musicians, as well as students, to make
use of the technique. These bass lines with figures became known as ``figured
bass'' lines.

\href{images/Bach1033.png}{\includegraphics{images/Bach1033.png}}

\emph{J.S. Bach, Flute Sonata in C Major, ii., BWV 1033. The upper part is
played by the flute, the lower part is the} basso continuo \emph{line, played
by a keyboardist who uses the numbers below the staff (figures) to guide the
chords played above this bass line.}

To this day, harpsichordists performing in Baroque ensembles will often put
their left hand to the same ``bass'' line that the cellos play, and will
improvise right-hand chords (with contrapuntally sound embellishment)
according to the figures provided with the bass line.

Though most music students are not Baroque keyboard specialists in training,
thoroughbass, or \emph{basso continuo}, can be a valuable tool in the study of
harmony and voice-leading. In the study of harmony, a thoroughbass line can
play a valuable role as a harmonic \emph{reduction} of a complex texture, in
order to example and understand better the harmonic skeleton underlying a
passage. In aural dictation, transcription, and analysis, the bass line and
the melody are often the most prominent (and most important) lines in a
passage, and knowing how the inner voices tend to relate to the bass line and
melody can aid in a number of listening and aural-analysis tasks. In
voice-leading, the \emph{basso continuo} texture affords a straightforward
environment in which to make a gradual, staged progression through the
intricacies of writing musical lines in a harmonic texture---and to do so
without paying significant attention to harmony.

\emph{Basso continuo} (It. for ``continuous bass'' or ``thoroughbass'') is
essentially a chordal version of first-species counterpoint. However, instead
of composing a single line above a cantus firmus, one composes a succession of
chords (performed in the right hand) above a bass line (performed in the left
hand). \emph{Basso continuo} writing, also referred to as \emph{realizing a
figured bass}, gives no consideration to melody, only to the use of proper
chords and the smoothest voice-leading possible. Thus, \emph{basso continuo}
style is a simple place to begin engaging the ``fundamental musical problems''
that arise when more than two lines are combined.

The historical origin of the thoroughbass part was in church settings where a
piece for 6--8 singers was to be performed by one or two voices with a
keyboard instrument. The keyboardist, rather than play the 4--7 remaining
parts, would transcribe the lowest note and shorthand figures to indicate the
(simple) intervals present above that lowest voice. This would allow the
keyboardist to play one or two of the more important lines, and fill the rest
of the texture with blocked or arpeggiated chords. (Think seventeenth-century
lead sheet.) A good keyboardist, who knew their harmony and voice-leading,
could simply follow the bass line without figures (an \emph{unfigured bass})
and listen to the melody, improvising the rest. Less experienced keyboardists,
however, could manage otherwise complicated pieces by reading a bass line and
memorizing a small number of figures and basic voice-leading rules.

Coming after species counterpoint in our studies, \emph{basso continuo}
exercises provide a new, more complicated environment in which to practice
mediating the demands of smoothness, independence of lines, tonal fusion (now
considering triads and seventh chords), variety, and motion. New
considerations of performability are introduced, and the presence of
dissonances within the core harmonies themselves will call for new approaches
to harmonic dissonance in this style.

We will use thoroughbass lines for a number of purposes in this book:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  harmonic ``reductions'' of pieces and passages with dense textures or
  complicated voice-leading\\
\item
  shorthand representations of stock harmonic patterns\\
\item
  the harmonic basis for model composition exercises (akin to the \emph{cantus
  firmus} of species counterpoint)
\end{itemize}

Thoroughbass is a simple, and foundational, concept. Master it early, and
subsequent activities will be much easier.

Note on figure placement: Thoroughbass figures can appear above or below the
bass line. Both are common, but in this book, we generally place them
\emph{above} the bass line. This connects them to our habits of interval
analysis during species counterpoint, keeps figures separate from other
harmonic symbols we will place below the bass line, and make typesetting in
notation software easier when both figures and other symbols are in play
simultaneously.

\hypertarget{figures}{%
\section{Figures}\label{figures}}

In general, a thoroughbass figure indicates the \emph{simple intervals above
the bass} for all pitch classes present in the chord.

The largest number typically found in thoroughbass figures is 7. In general,
\emph{compound intervals} (an octave or larger) are reduced to their
\emph{simple interval} equivalent. A tenth becomes a third, a thirteenth
becomes a sixth, etc.

The most common chords in tonal music are \href{triads.html}{\emph{triads} and
\emph{seventh chords}}. The following figures apply to these chords:

\includegraphics{images/harmony/figuresFull.png}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  5/3: use a fifth and a third above the bass (one note of the chord will be
  doubled)\\
\item
  6/3: use a sixth and a third above the bass (one note of the chord will be
  doubled)\\
\item
  6/4: use a sixth and a fourth above the bass (one note of the chord will be
  doubled)\\
\item
  7/5/3: use a seventh, a fifth, and a third above the bass\\
\item
  6/5/3: use a sixth, a fifth, and a third above the bass\\
\item
  6/4/3: use a sixth, a fourth, and a third above the bass\\
\item
  6/4/2: a use a sixth, a fourth, and a second above the bass
\end{itemize}

These figures are so common, that most of them have shortcuts:

\includegraphics{images/harmony/figuresAbbrev.png}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  no figure = 5/3\\
\item
  6 = 6/3\\
\item
  6/4 is never abbreviated\\
\item
  7 = 7/5/3\\
\item
  6/5 = 6/5/3\\
\item
  4/3 = 6/4/3\\
\item
  4/2 (or just 2) = 6/4/2
\end{itemize}

Other shortcuts for figured bass realization generally follow two simple
rules:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Assume a fifth is present above the bass unless there is a ``6'' in the
  figure.\\
\item
  Assume a third is present above the bass unless there is a ``4'' or a ``2''
  in the figure.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{unfamiliar-figures-and-chords}{%
\section{Unfamiliar figures and chords}\label{unfamiliar-figures-and-chords}}

Only seven figures are given above. If you see a figure you do not recognize,
simply follow the intervals (using the two shortcut rules). Likewise, if
analyzing a chord that is not a triad or seventh chord, simply label the
\emph{simple} intervals you see/hear above the bass, from top to bottom in
descending order: 7/6/3 or 5/4, for example. In time, you will become familiar
with a number of other harmonic possibilities, and their corresponding
figures.

\section{Chords of the fifth and chords of the
sixth}\label{chords-of-the-fifth-and-chords-of-the-sixth}}

All chords can be categorized as either a \emph{chord of the fifth} or a
\emph{chord of the sixth}. This distinction will be important for our study of
voice-leading.

A \emph{chord of the fifth} contains a fifth above the bass, but no sixth
above the bass.

A \emph{chord of the sixth} contains a sixth above the bass.

\hypertarget{chromatic-alteration}{%
\section{Chromatic alteration}\label{chromatic-alteration}}

If a note is chromatically altered (different than the key signature), the
figure must be altered as well. Since bass notes are already present in the
bass, a chromatic alteration in the bass will not make it into the figure.
However, any other alteration in the upper voices (such as a raised leading
tone in minor) must be reflected in the figure. To do so, simply put a sharp,
flat, or natural to the left of the appropriate number.

Of course, there are some shortcuts. For example, draw a line (a ``slash'')
through a number to denote that it is raised by half-step (can substitute both
for sharp or for natural). Also, when altering the third above the bass,
simply use the sharp, flat, or natural and leave out the ``3.''

\includegraphics{images/harmony/figuresChrom.png}

In general, if there is a shortcut available, use it. The shortcuts are more
standard than the corresponding full notation.

Keep in mind that some chords have abbreviated figures. For example, it is
common for the leading tone to be the third above the bass in a 5/3 chord. In
such a situation, a bass note that otherwise would have no figure needs a
sharp or a natural for its thoroughbass figure.

After having developed voice-leading procedures in Unit 7a, you should now
understand why the voice-leading between V and I creates tension and release.
This progression defines tonal harmony, and it is from this that we derive our
three primary function classifications: tonic, dominant, and pre-dominant
function. While it is easy to memorize which chords belong to each of the
primary functions, it is more important to understand how and why these
functions work. - The most stable harmony is built around the tonic of the
key, so stable chords have a \emph{tonic} function. - The harmonies that pull
strongly to \emph{tonic} function are built around the dominant of the key, so
these chords have a \emph{dominant} function. - There are also harmonies that
resolve well to the \emph{dominant} function chords, so these have a
\emph{pre-dominant} function. - Some systems call these chords
\emph{subdominant} function because they all share the fourth scale degree. We
already use words such as ``dominant'' and ``tonic'' in a variety of ways
(e.g.~scale degrees, harmonic function, chord types, etc.), so we will be
differentiating pre-dominant from subdominant to create slightly less
confusion.

These harmonic functions shape every musical phrase, and nowhere is that more
obvious than in studying how phrases end. \emph{Cadences} are the term that we
use to describe the harmonic progression at the end of a musical phrase. If a
musical phrase could be considered equivalent to a written sentence, then the
\emph{cadence} is the period at the end of that sentence. All cadences finish
a phrase, but not all cadences provide closure and stability. In fact, some
cadences are purposefully unsettled.

We will study the chords associated with classifying cadences, but it takes
far more than a particular harmonic progression to create a cadence. In
addition to chord progressions, cadences are affected by melodic shapes,
melodic rhythm, harmonic rhythm, context, meter, and many other elements of
music.

For this course, we will study six types of cadences: - \emph{perfect
authentic cadence (PAC)} - \emph{imperfect authentic cadence (IAC)} -
\emph{half cadence (HC)} - \emph{deceptive cadence (DC)} - \emph{plagal
cadence (PC)} - \emph{phrygian half cadence (PHC)}

\emph{Take special care to remember the abbreviations in parentheses for each
cadence type. These will be used repeatedly in your analyses.}

We now have the analytical foundation and tools to begin studying harmonic
\emph{function}--how and why a chord works with other chords to build
tonality. In this lesson, we will derive the basic aspects of function by
combining two major concepts from previous units: 1. As shown in the two-part
examples in \href{06-intro-harmonic/b1-diafuncvoicelead.html}{Unit 6b}, the
progression from V7 to I creates a strong and natural sense of resolution.
There are many reasons we hear this progression as a strong cadence, but
perhaps the strongest reason is the voice-leading between the V7 and I
chords--meaning the way in which individual pitches naturally pull toward each
other. 2. When written as a scale, diatonic collections are simply a sequence
of five whole steps and two half-steps--the major scale, for example, is
W-W-H-W-W-W-H--but as we determined in
\href{02-int-scales-keys/d1-keys.html}{Unit 2c}, you can find all seven
pitches in the diatonic collection by altering a a single half-step in a
circle-of-fifths. This alteration changes one of the P5 intervals to a d5, and
it is these two pitches within the diatonic collection, \texttt{ti} and
\texttt{fa}, that establish the voice leading that pulls V7 to I and therefore
around which tonal harmony is constructed.

As a side note, the significance of cultural conditioning cannot be
overlooked. A person who grows up listening to \emph{any} style of music will
be conditioned to hear the tendencies used in that music as a natural
progression, and this holds true for those raised around music descended from
the diatonic tradition. This does not change the importance of voice-leading
in forming these progressions, but it is worth remembering the difference
between laws, rules, and strategies discussed in the first reading from Unit
6.

The examples below demonstrate how these half-steps create this the foundation
of diatonic harmony. If you understand the voice-leading principles that pull
the V chord into the I chord, you can then extend these rules to create the
basic progression from which all diatonic harmony evolves.

\hypertarget{goals-for-this-topic}{%
\section{Goals for this topic}\label{goals-for-this-topic}}

The next five examples are meant to expose the logic behind the voice-leading
of standard diatonic harmonies. To use these, study each example before moving
on to the next and form a hypothesis regarding the voice leading (which chord
tones resolve or pull to other chord tones). Once you have developed a theory
as to how and why the progression works, move to the next example to see if
your hypothesis can be applied. If it cannot, alter your hypothesis to account
for both examples. Continue this way until you have found voice-leading rules
that apply to all of the examples.

\textbf{This example has two idealized progressions of a V chord resolving to
a I chord: one as triads and the other with a seventh chord.} - Study how each
voice resolves. - It is tempting to focus on which scale degree resolves to
which scale degree (e.g.~\texttt{ti} to \texttt{do}), but this does not
provide a complete explanation. - Instead focus on the how each chordal member
resolves in the progression. This should include the chordal member to which
it resolves and the interval necessary to do so. - Try to discern which
chordal members have multiple options and which seem locked into a specific
resolution. - What pitches are doubled? Are any omitted?

\hypertarget{conclusions-2}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-2}}

As we look at implied harmony in two-voice counterpoint, we can demonstrate
that simple voice-leading is all that is necessary to \emph{imply} diatonic
function. If we take that further, we should be able to create the
fundamentals of harmonic progression using the voice-leading inherent in
diatonic systems.

Beginning theory students often learn two general rules of thumb for
voice-leading: - \texttt{ti} resolves to \texttt{do} - \texttt{fa} resolves to
\texttt{mi}

This is helpful to begin thinking about voice-leading in the most basic of
ways, but it only applies to a specific, albeit common, set of circumstances
that arise in common practice harmony--the V7 to I progression. In contrast to
those rules, look at the following two-voice outline of one of the most common
progressions in tonal music.

G,C,\textbar{]} w:C:I6 IV V I\{\% endcapture \%\} \{\% include
abc-example.html number=``6'' abc=ex6 \%\}

In this common progression, the bass voice moves \texttt{fa} to \texttt{sol},
and it sounds acceptable to almost anyone's ear. From this alone, you should
infer that there is far more detail necessary to understand voice-leading.

So instead, you must base your general rules around \emph{chordal members} and
their resolutions, rather than scale degrees and their resolutions.
Specifically: - For chords that have roots separated by a P5: - The
\emph{seventh} of the first chord resolves to the \emph{third} of the second
chord. - the \emph{third} of the first chord resolves to the \emph{root} of
the second chord. - If both chords are in root position, the bass voice moves
from the \emph{root} of the first chord to the \emph{root} of the next chord.

Before moving on, take a moment to check these rules against the finished
example from above, copied below for your convenience.

You can also alter this example to include seventh chords in order to apply
the chordal seventh resolutions, but we will do that in the next topic.

\hypertarget{adding-iv-and-viio}{%
\section{Adding IV and viio}\label{adding-iv-and-viio}}

\textbf{Beyond the iii chord, the voice-leading runs into an issue with
harmonic function. While it is possible to continue this pattern through these
two chords, in tonal harmony, the IV and viio chords actually function most
often as if they are extensions of the ii7 and V7 chords respectively. Look at
the following example to see voice-leading using both of these chords. The
first measure uses the ii7 and V7 chords as part of a diatonic progression,
but the second progression substitutes the IV for the ii7 chord and the viio
chord for the V7 chord. After looking at this example, explain why IV and viio
function similarly to ii7 and V7.}

\emph{Please note that to demonstrate how closely related these chords are,
many voice-leading rules of common practice harmony are broken in this
example--most notably the parallel octaves between the soprano and bass
between viio and I. This is for demonstration purposes only, do not assume
that this is good voice-leading for IV or viio. We will discuss the rules of
voice-leading in this style when we study part-writing in Units 10 and 11.}

\hypertarget{conclusions-3}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-3}}

It is possible to continue our voice-leading pattern backwards to add the last
two diatonic chords, IV and viio, but these chords actually function
differently. Instead, the IV and viio chords function similarly to their two
functional counterparts, ii7 and V7. The logic is fairly simple, if you remove
the root from a ii7 chord, \texttt{D-F-A-C} in C major, you are left with a IV
chord, \texttt{F-A-C}. Likewise, if you remove the root from a V7 chord, you
are left with a viio chord. By this logic, the IV and viio chords often use
alternative voice leading, because their tendency tones are not necessarily
tied to the chordal thirds and sevenths.

When we add these to our harmonic progression flowchart, we get our basic
outline for harmonic progressions.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lllll@{}}
\toprule
(\emph{unnamed}) & (\emph{unnamed}) & pre-dominant & dominant & tonic \\
\midrule
\endhead
iii & vi & ii & V & I \\

\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Using just this flowchart, you can build basic chordal progressions for a
given melody by harmonizing the pitches with the correct progressions. Please
note that the I chord can comfortably jump back to anywhere in the
progressions.

\hypertarget{adding-in-exceptions}{%
\section{Adding in Exceptions}\label{adding-in-exceptions}}

There are a few common exceptions that should be added to this progression
flowchart. We will discuss how these are used as we work through their
appropriate topics (e.g.~cadences, chordal substitutions), but for now, please
add them to your list of possible progressions. - chords that have the same
function can move to each other - V can move to viio, and viio can move to V -
ii can move to IV, and IV can move to ii. - V can move to vi - This is most
commonly used at the end of a phrase. In this case, vi is ``replacing'' a I
chord and assuming a tonic function, so it must be used and voice carefully.
See \href{07-harmonic-functions/c1-cadences.html}{Unit 7c} (later in this
unit) for a full explanation of cadences. - IV can go to I - This is most
commonly used at the end of a phrase, and in this case, IV is ``replacing''
the V chord. This is another cadence, so it must be prepared properly. It is
better to avoid using this progression in the middle of a phrase, so in your
early attempts at part-writing, do not attempt to use this. - UNCOMMON: vi can
move to V - There are instances where vi will move to V, but in these cases,
it is best to think of the vi chord as taking on a tonic function. In your
early part-writing, do not use this progression, because like V moving to
vi--a much more common progression--this progression is likely to result in
poor voice-leading. - RARE: iii can move to IV - It is difficult to use this
without creating multiple voice-leading issues, so in your early attempts at
part-writing, do not attempt to use this.

\hypertarget{changes-in-minor}{%
\section{Changes in Minor}\label{changes-in-minor}}

Minor follows all of the same progressions and exceptions, but the chord
qualities change to match the naturally occurring pitches in the key
signature. Please remember that minor keys must have a major V chord and
diminished vii chord to function diatonically. This means that both of these
chords are built using the raised seventh scale degree, even though this isn't
necessarily implied by the Roman numeral of the viio.

In Unit 4, we discussed the two most common classifications of meter: simple
and compound. In this lesson, we will add two more advanced classifications as
well as discuss the idea of how beat and division relationships can be used to
combine them.

\hypertarget{asymetric-irregular-meters}{%
\section{Asymetric (irregular) meters}\label{asymetric-irregular-meters}}

In the example below, each line shows a metric pattern of of a meter that we
have not yet defined in our studies so far. These meters are grouped in pairs,
so the first two lines are related, the third and fourth lines are related,
and the fifth and sixth lines are related. (The 1/1 time signature is just a
placeholder and has nothing to do with these meters.) How would you label
these ? Can your knowledge of simple and compound meters apply to these? What
rhythmic value gets the beat for each line?

\hypertarget{and-88-meters}{%
\section{5/8, 7/8, and 8/8 meters}\label{and-88-meters}}

In the patterns above, the beaming and pitch patterns show clear groupings of
division, but if we use these grouping to define our beats, we realize that
each measure is a mixture of a simple and compound beats--some are grouped in
two while others are grouped in three. Any meter in which the beats have
varying lengths is considered to be an \emph{asymetric meter} or
\emph{irregular meter}.

\hypertarget{section}{%
\subsection{5/8}\label{section}}

The first two lines of the above example will be labeled as 5/8. The first
line has five eighth notes in each measure but alternates between groups of
two then three. The second line reverses the order of the grouping to three
then two, but the number of divisions (eighth notes) remains the same.
Therefore, 5/8 meters have \textbf{two} beats of unequal length -- a quarter
note and a dotted quarter note. The quarter note has a division of two eighth
notes, and the dotted quarter note has a division of three.

The exception to this is when the tempo is slow enough that the eighth note
becomes the beat, in which case, this meter becomes a simple quintuple meter
with each eighth note divided into two sixteenth notes. When discussing an
asymetric meter such as this with other musicians, it is often helpful to
describe it using groupings of twos of threes. The first line below is ``two
plus three,'' and the second line is ``three plus two.'' Try conducting along
with both of these.

\hypertarget{section-1}{%

Lines 3 and 4 of the first example will be labeled as 7/8. Lines 3 and 4 are
similar to Lines 1 and 2 in that they have irregular groupings of two and
three eighth notes, but instead of consisting of five eighth notes, each
measure has a total of seven. Because they are grouped into groups of two and
three, 7/8 meters have \textbf{three} beats of unequal length--two quarter
notes and one dotted quarter note. Also like 5/8, the exception to this is
when the tempo is slow enough that the eighth note becomes the beat, in which
case, this meter becomes a simple septuple meter with each eighth note divided
into two sixteenth notes.

The beat groupings can come in any order as shown below. Try conducting along

Lines 5 and 6 of the first example will be labeled as 8/8. Lines 3 and 4 are
similar to Lines 1 and 2 in that they have irregular groupings of two and
three eighth notes, but each measure now has a total of eight. Because they
are grouped into groups of two and three, 8/8 meters have \textbf{three} beats
of unequal length--one quarter note and two dotted quarter notes. As with all
irregular meters, the exception to this is when the tempo is slow enough that
the eighth note becomes the beat, in which case, this meter becomes a simple
septuple meter with each eighth note divided into two sixteenth notes.

Note the similarity to 7/8; both of these assymetric meters have three beats,
but where 7/8 has two quarter notes, 8/8 has two \emph{dotted} quarter notes.
The beat groupings can come in any order as shown below. Try conducting along
with these.

In Unit 16, we looked at the most common methods used in music to modulate
from one key center to another. - pivot chord modulations - common-tone
modulations - phrase (direct) modulations

In the majority of those examples, the modulation was to a closely related
key, allowing the modulatory methods to rely on the number of pitches and
chords that were common to both keys. When music modulates to a distant
key--without passing through multiple intermediary keys--the methods for
modulation require more complicated techniques.

The following examples demonstrate advanced modulatory methods in simplistic
renditions of a four-part chorale. They are written in such a way to highlight
a particular modulatory technique and are grouped in pairs to give you
multiple examples of the same idea. Listen to each pair of examples, and
identify the commonalities within each pair. For each example: - Write the
leadsheet symbols above each chord. - When approaching an unfamiliar piece of
music, it is often helpful to begin by looking for patterns in the large-scale
chordal structure of the piece rather than getting hung up in the minutiae of
each passage. - Determine the keys in which the excerpt begins and ends by
looking for cadences. - This will require you to use your ear training skills
to determine the tonic at each cadence. - Write Roman numerals from the
beginning of the piece until you come to a place where they no longer make
sense in that key. - Work backward from the end of the piece to create Roman
numerals for the second key. - When you come to the bridge between the two
keys, try to determine what ties the pieces together. - It will be helpful to
consider the guidelines of each modulatory technique that you have already
learned. - Do your Roman numerals meet in the \emph{middle} of the phrase as
would be expected of a standard pivot chord modulation? Does the modulation
happen between phrases as is standard in a direct modulation? Does the
modulation involve one or more isolated common-tones?

\hypertarget{mode-mixture-pivot-chords}{%
\section{Mode mixture pivot chords}\label{mode-mixture-pivot-chords}}

The Group A examples modulate by pivoting on a borrowed chord (mode mixture).
The first phrase establishes the original key but uses a borrowed chord to
provide a colorful alteration. In the second phrase, the borrowed chord is
then turned into a pivot chord. For Modulation 1, the borrowed bVI chord
becomes a V in the key of D-flat major. In Modulation 2, the borrowed iv chord
becomes the ii chord in the key of E-flat major.

As with all pivot chord modulations, these will typically occur in the middle
of the phrase because a pivot chord modulation relies on having a functional
chord progression on both sides of the pivot. The smoother the chord
progression on both sides, the smoother the modulation will sound.

\hypertarget{enharmonic-respelling-of-a-viio7-chord}{%
\section{Enharmonic respelling of a viio7
chord}\label{enharmonic-respelling-of-a-viio7-chord}}

The excerpts in Group B demonstrate the extreme flexibility of a fully
diminshed seventh chord. Because this chord is symmetrical, it can be
enharmonically respelled to form four different chords. Look at the chart
below to see how one diminished seventh chord can be respelled to be four
different chords.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
Spelling 1 & Spelling 2 & Spelling 3 & Spelling 4 \\
\midrule
\endhead
A-flat & G-sharp & G-sharp & A-flat \\
F & F & E-sharp & F \\
D & D & D & D \\
B & B & B & C-flat \\
viio7/C & viio6/5/A & viio4/3/F-sharp & viio4/2/E-flat \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

The way in which a fully diminished chord is spelled denotes the key in which
it will naturally occur. These keys are shown in the bottom row of the chart
along with the inversion figure for this particular spelling.

In Modulation 3 above, the first phrase uses a viio4/2 chord as a passing
chord to move into a cadential 6/4 progression. In the second phrase, this
viio4/2 chord is respelled to become a viio7 thus creating a functional pivot
into the new key of A major.

Modulation 4 begins identically to Modulation 3, but when we reach the viio4/2
in the second phrase, it is respelled as a viio4/3 which acts as the pivot
into the new key of F-sharp minor.

Note that there are even further possibilities for modulations if the fully
diminished chord is used a secondary leading-tone chord (viio7/x) in one or
both of the keys.

\hypertarget{enharmonic-respelling-of-a-ger6-chord}{%
\section{Enharmonic respelling of a Ger+6
chord}\label{enharmonic-respelling-of-a-ger6-chord}}

Both of the examples in Group C use the fact that a Ger+6 chord is
enharmonically equivalent to a dominant seven chord, and this can be used to
create V7 in a distant key. The first phrase of Modulation 5 is a standard
diatonic progression, but in the second phrase, the V7 chord is enharmonically
respelled to become the Ger+6 in the key of B major. As is typical of a Ger+6,
it moves through a cadential 6/4 chord before finishing on a perfect authentic
cadence.

Modulation 6 uses a Ger+6 as the predominant in the first phrase, but in the
second phrase, the Ger+6 is respelled to become an A-flat dominant seventh
chord; allowing it to become the V7 chord in the key of D-flat major.

\hypertarget{other-symmetrical-chords}{%
\section{Other symmetrical chords}\label{other-symmetrical-chords}}

There is one other symmetrical chord which can be enharmonically respelled
that we will not cover in this section. The Fr+6 chord can be respelled to
become a different Fr+6 chord because it contains two whole steps separated by
a M3 on either side. For example, the Fr+6 in C major consists of pitches the
A-flat, C, D, and F-sharp. If the F-sharp is respelled as a G-flat, the chord
can be re-arranged to become the Fr+6 in the key of G-flat (D, G-flat, A-flat,
and C). This is not a common modulation, but it is worth remembering in the
rare chance that you encounter this in a piece of music.

\hypertarget{final-notes}{%
\section{Final notes}\label{final-notes}}

As with all modulation techniques, these modulatory tricks rely on setting the
listener's expectations before presenting them with a dramatic modulation.
Because chords such as the Ger+6 are less common than standard diatonic
progressions, it is most common to see these sorts of modulations in a second
phrase after having established the uncommon chord or progression functioning
``normally'' in the first phrase. This creates the sense of expectation for
the second phrase before the surprise of the modulation.

While every chord we have studied in the course thus far has been based in
tertian harmony, the chords that we will explore do not rely on intervals of
the third for their construction. Although they are no more difficult to
understand functionally. Interestingly, this chord type comes in three
different variants. (You can think of them as ``flavors'' if you'd like.)

\hypertarget{augmented-sixth-6-chords}{%
\section{Augmented sixth (+6) chords}\label{augmented-sixth-6-chords}}

Analyze and listen to the following short progressions. There are two
progressions -- one in major, one in the parallel minor -- for each of the
three variants of this unusual chord. Start your analysis with leadsheet
symbols and then provide Roman numerals when possible. In each progression,
study the chromatic chord to answer the following questions: - How could you
describe its construction? (Hint: Pay special attention to the scale degrees.)
- How does it function? (e.g.~tonic, passing, etc.) - Does it have tendency
tones, and if so, how do they resolve? - What do the three variants have in
common and what differentiates each of them? - If you were to compare it to a
diatonic or chromatic chord that normally fulfills this function, which chord
shares the most commonalities with it? - Do they seem most ``at home'' in
major or minor?

\subsubsection{Building augmented sixth
chords}\label{building-augmented-sixth-chords}}

The augmented sixth chords are collections of pitches that create smooth
voice-leading. They function based on their voice-leading only, not tertian
harmony, so it is unhelpful to describe them using standard chord terms such
as root, third, and fifth. Instead, we typically describe the chordal members
by their scale degrees. In the table below, you can see that all augmented
sixth chords share three common tones -- \^{}b6, \^{}1, and \^{}\#4. As you
hopefully determined from the first examples, the Italian variant consists of
only the three primary pitches whereas the German and French variations have
an added tone. (For ease of communication, I will always refer to the lowered
sixth scale degree as \^{}b6 even though it is already lowered by the key
signature in minor. This goes the same for the \^{}b3 in German augmented
sixth chords.)

Augmented sixth chords are named because of the augmented sixth interval that
is created between the \^{}b6 and \^{}\#4. This interval also creates the
defining voice-leading feature for this chord. Look at the following examples.
How does the augmented sixth resolve? How does it change if it is inverted?
Does resolving the tendency tones in any of the chords present voice-leading
issues.

\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-5}}

As you can see, the tendency tones of the augmented sixth--\^{}b6 and
\^{}\#4--will always resolve by a half-step. If the \^{}b6 is in a lower voice
than the \^{}\#4, they will resolve outward by half-step to an octave. If the
\^{}\#4 is in a lower voice than the \^{}b6, they will resolve inward by
half-step to create an octave. The resolution of this interval is the entire
reason for the existence of these augmented sixth chords, so you can consider
this resolution of the defining characteristic of these chords.

\section{Augmented sixth chords resolving to V7 and
I6/4}\label{augmented-sixth-chords-resolving-to-v7-and-i64}}

There are certainly voice-leading issues when resolving augmented sixth
chords, but the chromatic element, particularly the \^{}\#4, somewhat
camouflages the objectionable parallels. Most obviously, when a Ger+6 resolves
directly to a V chord, parallel perfect fifths will result when resolving the
\^{}b6 and \^{}b3 scale degrees. For this reason, there are alternate
resolutions for augmented sixth chords that are often preferable. Look at the
next example to see two possible fixes for this. Does the cadential I6/4 fix
the likely objectionable parallels for a Ger+6? Why does the Ger+6 have an
enharmonically spelled pitch when resolving to a cadential I6/4? When an
augmented sixth chord resolves to a V7, what changes about the resolution of
the tendency tones in the augmented sixth chord?

\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-6}}

Passing through another chord can hide the objectionable parallels created by
the tendency tones of the Ger+6. In particular, a cadential 6/4 chord can
still provide the standard resolutions for the tendency tone (to the dominant
scale degree) but also provides an outlet for the \^{}b3 to resolve by
half-step to the third of the I6/4 as you can see in the first example. In
this case, the \^{}b3 will often be re-spelled to a \^{}\#2, but this does not
change the function or labeling of the chord.

The other option that is commonly used is resolving any augmented sixth chord
to a V7 chord rather than a triad. In this case though, the smoothest
resolution to the seventh of the V7 is to alter the resolution of one of the
tones that create the augmented sixth interval--particularly, the \^{}\#4.
Instead of resolving upward by half-step to \texttt{sol}, you can resolve the
\^{}\#4 \emph{downward by half-step} to the seventh of the V7 as demonstrated
in the second example above.

\section{Labeling augmented sixth
chords}\label{labeling-augmented-sixth-chords}}

As you probably noticed in the examples above, there is no change in the
inversion figure for any of the augmented sixth chords. Because these are not
based in tertian harmony, there is no standard inversion figure that would
explain the intervals. Therefore, rather than create an entirely new set of
inversion figures for one uncommon chord, we simply notate each of these
chords with the same ``Roman numeral'' symbol, regardless of inversion. They
are:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}

\section{Alternate resolutions of the augmented
sixth}\label{alternate-resolutions-of-the-augmented-sixth}}

In all of the examples thus far, the interval between the \^{}b6 and \^{}\#4
-- augmented sixth -- has resolved outward to emphasize a specific scale
degree, \^{}5 or \texttt{sol}. Because of this, we assume that a standard
augmented sixth chord has a predominant function, \emph{because it emphasizes
the root of the dominant}. As with any colorful chord, however, composers do
not restrict themselves to this one usage. Analyze the following example. How
would you describe what is happening in the penultimate chord?

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

The penultimate chord does not function as tertian harmony, and it clearly
resolves as an augmented sixth chord. The D-flat and B-natural form an
augmented sixth that resolves outward by half-step, and the two inner voices
create a German+6\ldots in a different key.

These non-dominant resolutions present an issue for standard Roman numeral
notation. Before reading on, take a moment and try to come up with a label for
the the augmented sixth chord in the previous example. The standard German
augmented sixth in that key (C major) would have an A-flat, C, E-flat, and
F-sharp, so you cannot simply label it as Ger+6.

Augmented sixth chords are similar to secondary dominant functions in that
they embellish a chord using chromatic alterations that strengthen voice
leading. A tonicization, however, temporarily treats a non-tonic chord as if
it were tonic. Our notation for secondary dominants shows this by using a
slash to imply that we are temporarily working in the key of the chord below
the slash. In the example above, the augmented sixth chord is the standard
Ger+6 in the key of F major, so some theory methods suggest that you should
use a slash to label this as Ger+6/IV, because this chord would appear in the
key of F major. I find this inadequate because in the key of F major, this
chord would function as a pre-dominant harmony whereas it is clearly filling a
dominant function here. Other theory methods recommend that this chord be
labeled as Ger+6/I to show that it is meant to resolve to the I chord, but
this fundamentally alters what the slash means. A slash chord above a Roman
numeral means ``in the key of''; V/V implies a V chord in the key of the
dominant. Using Ger+6/I would mean the Ger+6 in the key of I--in this case, C
major--but the standard Ger+6 in the key of C major has A-flat, C, E-flat, and
F-sharp.

Instead, the least ambiguous option for alternate resolutions of augmented
sixth chords is to show what \emph{pitch} the chord is intended to embellish
by placing a scale degree below a slash. Therefore, the example above would be
labeled as Ger+6/\^{}1. Using a scale degree below the slash instead of a
Roman numeral makes it clear that the slash is functioning differently than
its use in labeling secondary functions.

\hypertarget{practicing-augmented-sixth-chords}{%
\section{Practicing augmented sixth
chords}\label{practicing-augmented-sixth-chords}}

Because augmented sixth chords are based entirely on the smooth voice leading
that they create, you could use an augmented sixth chord to embellish almost
\emph{any} harmony, although it does work best for major triads and dominant
chords. Try this for yourself in the following progression by inserting
augmented sixth chords at any spot marked with an x. You may change any note
necessary for the chord. Please note that each chord will need a
``customized'' augmented sixth chord that emphasizes its root; there is no
one-size-fits-all augmented sixth chord. For example, if you plan to use
Ger+6/ii, you would need to make sure that you are using an augmented sixth
chord that has an augmented sixth that resolves outward by half-step to \^{}2.

\hypertarget{what-is-a-modulation}{%
\section{What is a modulation?}\label{what-is-a-modulation}}

A \emph{modulation} occurs in a tonal piece of music when the tonic pitch
changes. Most musicians understand this concept on an intuitive level, but
there are a few common misconceptions. - Modulations are sometimes referred to
as a ``key change,'' but the key signature does not necessarily need to be
altered for a modulation to occur. Repeated accidentals are a more consistent
hint that a modulation may have happened. - The term ``key change'' also does
not account for the fact that a shift between the parallel major and minor
modes (e.g.~C major to C minor) is \emph{not} a modulation but do have
different key signatures. This is a shift in mode -- not a modulation --
because the tonic does not change.

\hypertarget{key-relationships}{%
\section{Key relationships}\label{key-relationships}}

In our first studies of modulation, we will look at modulations between
closely-related keys. \emph{Closely-related keys} are keys that are within one
accidental of each other. Each key has five closely-related keys. To practice,
write the closely-related keys for: - C major - A minor - C-sharp major -
E-flat minor

When determining closely-related keys, it is helpful to think of the
\emph{relative} major and minor keys as well as their closely-related keys,
but the \emph{parallel} major or minor is always a distantly-related key.

\hypertarget{conclusions-7}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-7}}

Any key will have five closely related keys: two of the same mode, and three
of the opposite mode. You can find these quickly by finding the relative
major/minor key of the starting key, and then adding one sharp and one flat to
both of these keys. For example, C major has a relative minor of A minor. If
you add a sharp to both of those key signatures you get G major and E minor.
If you add a flat to both of those key signatures, you get F major and D
minor. The chart below shows the closely related keys for the four examples
from above.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule

\hypertarget{differentiating-modulation-and-tonicization}{%
\section{Differentiating modulation and
tonicization?}\label{differentiating-modulation-and-tonicization}}

The biggest difficulty regarding modulation is differentiating between
modulation and tonicization. Some modulations will be obvious, but others can
be contentious. Because a modulation is defined by a change in the tonic, it
is necessary to consider how music establishes tonic in the listener's ear. In
earlier units, we discussed the importance of phrasing and cadences, but the
following exercise will further clarify their importance.

On a scratch piece of paper, do the following for each of the examples below:
1. Listen to the entire excerpt, and at the end, sing the tonic (\texttt{do}).
Use your ear-training while looking at the final chord to determine which
pitch you sang. Write this on your scratch paper. - If you are struggling to
identify your tonic, try singing along with the soprano line. Once you arrive
at the cadence, sing up and down the scale until you arrive at something that
feels completely stable. You should then be able to count the scale degrees
through which you must move to arrive at \texttt{do}. 2. Listen to the excerpt
again, but pause each time you come to the end of a phrase. Most of the
phrases in the excerpts below are marked by fermatas, but you should be able
to identify cadences as aurally as well. Each time you pause the excerpt, sing
your current \texttt{do}. This may require you to find a pitch that is not
present in the chord because some of the phrase endings do not have
\texttt{do} in the chord. (i.e.~if there is a half cadence) 3. Compare your
tonics from each phrase. Does it change throughout the excerpt? If so, you
should be able to pinpoint the phrase in which it modulated.

Some of these examples modulate, yet some are only tonicizations. What do all
of the modulations have in common? What about the tonicizations? How does this
change your perception of modulation? Is there some commonality among the
modulations that will help you visually identify a modulation if you do not
have access to playback or a recording?

Above all else, you will notice that we are not beginning our discussion of
modulation by looking at this from a theoretical perspective. Modulation is
determined by the listener, and you will often find yourself disagreeing with
others. In many cases, modulation is subjective, but this becomes more
concrete with experience.

After you have finished listening to each of these and feel that you have an
opinion on whether each modulated, go on to the next unit to begin studying
the most common methods that composers use to modulate.

To this point in the course, we have only studied harmony based on triads and
seventh chords, but as we have shown in the units covering chromaticism,
triads and seventh chords function in progressions due to the underlying voice
leading in diatonic harmony. If we look at the construction of melodies and
their interactions with vertical harmonies, we can find ways to expand the
tertian stack to include extensions beyond seventh chords that function as
chord tones.

Let us start by analyzing the following ``chorale'' arrangement based on the
famous tune \emph{The Girl from Ipanema} composed by Antonio Carlos Jobim.
Label each chord with leadsheet symbols and Roman numerals, while paying
particular attention to labeling all non-chord tones. Note that measure 6 is
particularly tricky, but you only need to look back into the previous unit for
a way to understand that harmony. For that measure, you may want to consider
the melody separately and enharmonically re-spell one pitch of the chorale
chord.

How did you deal with the first measure of this tune? It is clearly an Fmaj7
chord, but the melody starts prominently on the ninth of the chord, and that G
cannot be labeled as any kind of non-chord tone.

\hypertarget{extended-tertian-harmony-versus-non-chord-tones}{%
\section{Extended tertian harmony versus non-chord
tones}\label{extended-tertian-harmony-versus-non-chord-tones}}

The first measure of \emph{The Girl from Ipanema} is a perfect example of
functional extended harmonies and should help you begin creating a decision
tree to determine whether a tone is a non-chord tone or a functional
extension. Because the position of the \texttt{G} in the measure, it does not
fit the standard non-chord tone patterns that we established early in the
course. As you look at it further, it should be clear that this G is
\emph{functional}--it is critical to the texture and structure of this
chord--so we must consider it a chord tone, making this harmony an Fmaj9
chord. Measure 3 has a similar issue with the E in the melody over the G7

As we have discussed repeatedly in this course, harmonic analysis is the art
of determining which pitches are functional to the harmony and which pitches
are embellishment. As we move into an expanded view of tonal harmony, it is
imperative that you are extremely familiar with the details of non-chord tones
in Unit 9a, because these shapes will provide a foundation to help you begin
determining what is functional. Simply put, if you cannot label a pitch as one
of the possible non-chord tone shapes, then it is most likely a functioning
chord tone. If there are more than four pitches for a given harmony that fall
into this category, it means that you must consider the concept of extended
tertian harmonies such as ninth chords.

Before you go further, you may wish to refresh yourself on the Roman numeral
labeling conventions outlines in Unit 6a. In particular, the section that
discusses the terms add and sub are important to our labeling of extended
tertian harmonies.

\hypertarget{identifying-patterns}{%
\section{Identifying patterns}\label{identifying-patterns}}

While most musicians have at least a passing familiarity with extended tertian
harmonies in jazz and pop, they exist in all styles of tonal harmony. Analyze
the following examples by labeling all chords with Roman numerals, inversion
figures, and non-chord tones. After you attempt your analyses, read the
commentary below each example.

In this excerpt (D.420 no. 2), the melody in the first measure arpeggiates a B
minor triad, but this is superimposed over an obvious E7 in the left hand. My
first instinct is to try to eliminate either the E (to create a G\# diminished
seventh chord), or eliminate the F\# (to leave the E7). Both would be
functionally sound acting as a dominant function in the key, however, both the
E and F\# are in prominent positions -- the E is present throughout the
measure, and the F\# is not only the high point of the measure, but it is
approached and left by a leap. Because both pitches are functional to the
harmony, this is an obvious example of a ninth chord.

Label the harmony as V9. There are other systems for labeling extended
harmonies using Roman numerals. For example, some systems insist that you
should either include a 7 below the 9 for the inversion figure, but I feel
this is redundant if you are making proper use of the add and sub labels. Any
inversion figure that has a single number--e.g.~V9--includes all thirds below
it. In the same way that 7 is shorthand for for 7/5/3, 9 is shorthand for
9/7/5/3. Of note, if this chord did \emph{not} have a chordal seventh, I would
label it as Vadd9, which denotes a major triad with an added ninth (and no
seventh).

This piece is written for piano, but I separated the right hand into two
voices to highlight the possibility of a ninth. You can make many of the same
arguments for this excerpt as we did in the first: the ninth above this E7 in
measures 1, 3, and 5 is in a prominent position and present throughout the
measure. The difference is its melodic role. This ninth can easily be
explained as an accented neighbor tone. You must decide when listening to this
piece if you hear this F as functional or embellishing. I hear it as an
embellishment rather than a functioning chord tone.

This final excerpt is similar to the first excerpt in that chord in measures 1
and 5 emphasizes the root of the V chord (the A) by placing it alone in the
left hand on the downbeat, but clearly stacks a viio7 on the second and third
eighth notes of the measure. It would be possible to consider the A as a pedal
tone throughout the first eight measures and only analyze this measure as a
viio7, but when I listen to it, the A is in too prominent a position and I
hear it as defining the function of the chord. Because of this, I would label
both of the measures a V9 chords.

Tonal harmony is easiest to study when when it follows strict rules, and
because of this, we have studied harmonic function thus far through the lens
of major and minor keys. In real music however, the relationship between modes
is more fluid.

\section{Mode mixture (modal

Look at the following chart of the chords of parallel major and minor keys.
Compare the chords built off each diatonic scale degree. (e.g.~I to i, ii to
iio How many of these chords match qualities? Does this fit with your
perception of two keys that are distantly-related?

You will notice that the only common chords are the dominant function chords,
and even these \emph{require} alteration in minor to share function and
qualities. So if we think about this as we did when discussing modulations,
these keys should have little in common. On the other hand look at the
following basic progressions in both keys. Do these look unrelated? How does
the voice-leading differ between the two? How many chromatic pitches are
required to make the second progression function?

Even at a glance, you can see that the voice-leading in these two progressions
is identical with the only differences between the two resulting from the
altered pitches in the key signature. In particular, the resolution from the
sixth scale degree to the fifth scale degree is strengthened in minor, because
the resolution becomes a half-step between le and sol.

When studying the voice-leading of these two parallel modes, they seem almost
interchangeable.

And they are.

Alter the following progression in C major to ``borrow'' either the VI or iio
chords from minor. What chordal members do you have to alter for each chord?
What scale degrees are these? When you play it back does it sound acceptable?
What if you only alter both chords? Does this make it more or less jarring?

\hypertarget{conclusions-8}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-8}}

To borrow either iio or VI from minor, you must alter the sixth scale degree
for both, and the VI also requires an altered third scale degree. Regardless
of which chord you alter--or both--the progression is fairly convincing.
Borrowing from the minor mode greatly darkens the progression without changing
any of the voice-leading functions. Also, take note of how the roots of chords
are affected. The ii chord has a root of \texttt{re} in either the major or
minor mode and changes only in quality from a D minor to a D diminished chord.
The vi chord undergoes a more substantial change, because not only does its
quality change from minor to major, but it does this by changing the actual
root of the chord from \texttt{la} to \texttt{le}. Forgetting to alter the
root when borrowing chords from different modes is one of the most common
mistakes that students make when studying borrowed chords in mode mixture, so
always check your roots before building the chord.

Perhaps more importantly than even understanding which chords can be borrowed,
you must look at how they function. In this example, we are borrowing chords
directly from a circle-of-fifths progression. \emph{They are still fulfilling
their diatonic function, because the voice-leading is tendencies are the same
regardless of mode.} As with all Roman numeral analysis, its purpose is to
explain the function and provide context for a progression. So even though the
quality of this ii chord has changed and is no longer diatonic, the meaning of
the Roman numeral doesn't change unless you alter it with further information
such as labeling it as a passing or pedal chord. If you put iio without
further explanation, you are saying that it still has a pre-dominant function
in this context.

\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-9}}

Almost every chord can be substituted for its minor counterpart in this
progression without changing its function. The pre-dominant and tonic
functions can all be borrowed without altering their function, although
altering the tonic functions quickly changes the sense of whether we are
operating in the major or minor mode.

There are two chords that cannot be borrowed. The first is the minor v chord;
if you borrow this, you undermine the fundamental core of diatonic tonality,
so it sounds as if someone simply played a wrong note. The other
non-borrowable chord for this progression is the major VII chord that would be
built off of B-flat. Both of these chords demonstrate the importance of the
resolution from the leading tone to the tonic to establish dominant and tonic
function. This is the basis for tonal harmony.

Of note, you \emph{can} borrow the viio7 from minor because it still has a
leading tone.

\hypertarget{borrowing-from-the-parallel-major}{%
\section{Borrowing from the parallel
major}\label{borrowing-from-the-parallel-major}}

The next example uses the same progression in minor. Alter one chord at a time
to borrow it from the parallel major, and pay careful attention to which scale
degrees you are altering. Which progressions sound acceptable to you? How does
the voice-leading change when starting in minor? Pay careful attention to any
enharmonically equivalent resolutions.

even borrowed chords.

chordal seventh as a m7 above the root.

Test your knowledge of this by writing the correct borrowed chords for every
diatonic chord in a parallel major and minor. You may use the following chart
as a model. With all of these make sure that you build the chord off of the
correct root. For example, students often forget that to build a major VI
chord in major, the root is altered thereby changing the entire chord. (In C
major for example, the borrowed bVI chord is \emph{not} an A major triad.)

\hypertarget{commonly-used-mode-mixture}{%
\section{Commonly used mode mixture}\label{commonly-used-mode-mixture}}

As you discovered above, certain chords do not sound good -- or function at
all -- when borrowed. Because of this, there are a few chords that are
borrowed most often.

Because of voice-leading resolutions, it is easiest to borrow chords while in
major. The most commonly borrowed chords in major are: - viio7 (requires
lowered \^{}6) - iv (requires lowered \^{}6) - iiø7 (requires lowered \^{}6) -
iio (requires lowered \^{}6) - bVI (requires lowered \^{}6 and \^{}3) - bVII
(requires lowered \^{}7) - Be careful to look at the function of this chord.
Label it as V/III if it resolves to a borrowed bIII chord. Label it as bVII if
it resolves in any other way. - bIII (requires lowered \^{}7 and \^{}3)

Minor is more limited due to voice-leading limitations, but the following
chords are commonly borrowed: - I (requires raised \^{}3) - This is often used
to end a minor piece in Baroque and Classical music. It is used often enough
that it has a unique name: the Picardy (Picardie) third - IV (requires raised
\^{}6) - Commonly results when used in first inversion to create a scalar bass
line of sol-la-ti-do - \#vi (requires raised \^{}6 and \^{}3) - Commonly
results when used in root position to create a scalar bass line of
sol-la-ti-do

In Unit 22, we introduced \emph{integer notation} for \emph{pitch classes}.
Allen Forte first formalized this system in his seminal work, \emph{The
Structure of Atonal Music}, creating a broad analytical framework to
compensate for tonal analytical methods inadequacy when music leaves tonality.
His \emph{set theory} is a specialized form of analysis that looks for
intervallic patterns equally across all twelve chromatic pitches, rather than
focusing on the relationship between a central pitch (i.e.~tonic) and others.

\hypertarget{scratching-the-surface}{%
\section{Scratching the surface}\label{scratching-the-surface}}

\emph{Set theory} is a broad field of theoretical study, and we will only
introduce a few basic concepts in this unit. If you would like to explore this
topic further--and if you intend to go beyond the undergraduate level of music
study, you should--I highly recommend that you read some of the many fine
books written on the subject. My favorites include: - \emph{The Structure of
Atonal Music} - Allen Forte - \emph{Introduction to Post-tonal Theory} -
Joseph Straus - \emph{Basic Atonal Theory} - John Rahn

There have been numerous refinements and alterations to this method since the
first publication of Forte's text in 1973, so this unit will attempt to
distill the basics into a foundation that will make this sort of analysis more
accessible.

\hypertarget{notating-pitch-class-sets}{%
\section{Notating pitch-class sets}\label{notating-pitch-class-sets}}

When we introduced pc sets (pcs) in Unit 22, we did not formalize their
notation, however, because we will study various levels of organization within
pc sets, it is important to establish a standard form for writing an
\emph{unordered} pcs--a pitch class set that you have not specifically
organized according to a predetermined, formalized sorting method. For
unordered pcs, you should always notate this using \textbf{parentheses with a
comma between each pitch class}. The following are all examples of unordered
pc sets:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  (0,1,5,t)
\item
  (B-flat,C,D,G)
\item
  (2,4)
\item
  (0,1,3,5,6,7,8,9,e)
\item
  (B,C,D,E,F,G,A)
\end{itemize}

You will notice that it doesn't matter if you use pitch names or integer
notation; a pitch class set is any collection of pitch classes.

\hypertarget{modulo-12-arithmetic}{%
\section{Modulo 12 arithmetic}\label{modulo-12-arithmetic}}

Before we begin using integer notation to study pitch classes and pitch-class
sets, we must establish the mathematical method necessary for manipulating
pitches. Because music uses twelve equally-spaced pitches but our standard
counting system is based around tens, we must create a specific equivalency
around the number 12. For this, we use modulo 12 (mod12) arithmetic. You
already use modulo 12 arithmetic every time you count time in hours, assuming
that you use a 12-hour system. For example, if it is 11:00 and you have a
meeting in three hours, what time is your meeting? From experience, you
understand that when you reach 12, you must reset your counting to find the
meeting's start time at 2:00--not 14:00. (Again, this assumes that you are not
using a 12-hour clock cycle, not 24-hour.)

This is exactly how pitch-class integer notation works, although the system
begins numbering on 0 instead of 12. In this system, each time you pass 11,
you begin again at zero, therefore making every multiple of 12 equal to zero.
Complete the following chart to show the first two equivalencies for every
number in this system. Can you create a method to quickly find any level of
equivalency? What would happen if you crossed below zero?

\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-2}}

While it is easy to complete this chart by simply counting sequentially
downward within each column, it is still useful in that it demonstrates the
continuum that is mod12 arithmetic. All whole integers can be represented by
an integer between 0 and 11, giving us exactly one integer for every possible
pitch class in the chromatic system.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule

t (10) & 22 & 34 \\
e (11) & 23 & 35 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

This also works in moving backward. Using basic arithmetic, it is easy to
understand that 12 - 5 = 7. But because 12 is equivalent to 0 in mod12, this
also means that 0 - 5 = 7. This is correct, but it skips an step in
demonstrating how. - 0 - 5 = -5 - You must then convert -5 into an integer
between 0 and 11 using multiples of 12. Therefore, -5 + 12 = 7.

This shows that any whole integer, whether positive or negative, can be
converted to an integer between 0 and 11. You could create a similar chart to
the one above for negative integers.

Fixed-zero integer notation assigns the following integers to pitch-classes:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}

Pitch-class integer & Pitch 1 & Pitch 2 \\
\midrule
\endhead
0 & C & B-sharp \\

\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

This is relatively simple to memorize, but it is more important to consider
what these numbers truly represent. Consider the following pitch-class set:

\texttt{(E,\ F,\ G,\ B-flat)}

First, transpose these pitches up a P4 using our traditional intervallic
method for transposition, and as you do this, pay careful attention to the
process that you use for transposing. Do you think of each pitch as part of a
key? If so, what scale degree do you use for each pitch? Do you count
half-steps? Do you find the first pitch and then as the base for finding the
rest of the intervals?

Next: - Convert this pitch-class set into integer notation - Then add 5 to
each number - For any resulting number greater that 11, convert that number to
its lowest possible integer using mod12 from above. - For example, if you were
to get 13, you would need to subtract 12 to get 1. - Convert this new set of
integers into pitch letter names.

Did you get the same result as when you transposed the pitches using the
traditional method for pitch transposition? If so, why does this work? What do
the numbers for integer notation \emph{actually} represent? (Hint: it is not
the assigned pitches.)

\hypertarget{notating-transposition}{%
\section{Notating transposition}\label{notating-transposition}}

Hopefully, you came to the same result using both methods of transposition.
The pc set becomes (4,5,7,t), and then when you add 5 to each integer it
becomes (9,t,12,15). All numbers greater than 11 must be reduced by mod12, so
the set becomes (9,t,0,3). When these numbers are converted back into pitch
letter names, you get (A,B-flat,C,E-flat) which is exactly a P4 above the
original pc set.

This works, of course, because \emph{the numbers in integer notation actually
represent the number of half-steps above a given pitch}. When using fixed
zero, each integer represents that many half-steps above C. From this, we
derive the following chart, although if you have already memorized the
integers for fixed-zero notation, you can always ``reverse engineer'' this
chart using your knowledge of intervals within the C major scale.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}

When notating transposition, we write Tn where n = the interval by which you
will transpose. The example above would be notated:

T5(E, F, G, B-flat) = (A,B-flat,C,E-flat)

OR using integer notation

T5(4,5,7,t) = (9,t,0,3)

\hypertarget{transposing-downward}{%
\section{Transposing downward}\label{transposing-downward}}

Any positive integer implies a transposition upward, so a negative integer is
used to transpose downward. For example, perform the following transposition:

T-3(4,5,7,t)

This example is simple enough because each of the integers is easily reduced
by -3 to create (1,2,4,7). However, try the following:

T-5(4,5,7,t)

In this example, 4 - 5 = -1. What does -1 equal? Because we use mod12, you can
simply add 12 to this number to find its simplest equivalency.

-1 + 12 = 11

Just as you must reduce any number greater that 11 to an integer between 0 and
11, you must also increase any number less than 0. Therefore the set above is:

T-5(4,5,7,t) = (e,0,2,5)

\hypertarget{normal-form-normal-order}{%
\section{Normal form (normal order)}\label{normal-form-normal-order}}

In order to make comparing pc sets more useful, we need to use standardized
orders to create consistent comparisons. You can imagine how difficult it
would be to make sense of multiple pc sets if each set was in a random order.
For this, we use \emph{normal form}.

Normal form is similar to the way in which we analyze standard tonal harmony.
For example, how would you condense the following open voicing of a seventh
chord in its simplest form while retaining its inversion?

\{\% capture ex1 \%\}X: 1 T:C major seventh chord T:in an open voicing M:4/4
L:1 K:C V:1 {[}BG{]}\textbar{]} V:2 clef=bass {[}E,C{]}\textbar{]}\{\%
endcapture \%\} \{\% include abc-example.html number=``1'' abc=ex1 \%\}

Most people will reduce this to a closed-position chord such as the following,
because it shows every pitch and the inversion in the smallest space possible.
This makes it easy to see the intervals and construction of the chord:

\{\% capture ex2 \%\}X: 2 T:C major seventh chord T:in a closed voicing M:4/4
L:1 K:C V:1 {[}EBGc{]}\textbar{]}\{\% endcapture \%\} \{\% include
abc-example.html number=``2'' abc=ex2 \%\}

\emph{Normal form} (or \emph{normal order}) applies the same principles for
organizing pitches to pc sets as you did when rearranging this seventh chord.
\textbf{Normal form is an ascending arrangement of a pc set in which the
outside interval is smallest.} For example, take the following pc set and
arrange it so it fills the smallest space possible.

(1,7,t)

More precisely, find the ascending arrangement that has the smallest interval
between the outside pitch classes. You may use any method that works, but
common methods include using mod12, notating the pitches on a staff, or even
drawing the pitches on a clock face. As you work through this, consider the
speed and efficacy of each method that you try.

\hypertarget{conclusions-10}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-10}}

For this trichord, it is probably easiest to translate the pitches into
standard pitch letters, and then just treat it as a triad. In this case, the
pitches D-flat, G, and B-flat form a G diminished triad, so you can quickly
tell that the normal form for this should be:

{[}7,t,1{]}

Notice that when notating a pc set in normal form, the parentheses are
replaced by brackets. (This notation method is outlined by Joseph Straus in
his \emph{Introduction to Post-Tonal Theory}.)

But what happens when you have a more complicated and ambiguous pc set? Try
putting the next pentachord into normal form. What difficulties do you find?
Which method seems to get the quickest result? Which seems the most
consistent?

(1,3,7,t)

\hypertarget{breaking-ties-for-ordering-pcs}{%
\section{Breaking ``ties'' for ordering
pcs}\label{breaking-ties-for-ordering-pcs}}

With any pcs, it is possible that there are multiple arrangements that have
the same interval between the outside pitches. Try putting the following
trichord into normal form.

(0,5,7)

If you arrange this on a staff in all possible ascending orders, you get:

\{\% capture ex3 \%\}X: 3 T:Three possible arrangements of (0,5,7) M:4/4 L:1
K:C V:1 {[}CFG{]}\textbar{} {[}FGc{]}\textbar{} {[}Gcf{]}\textbar{]}\{\%

\hypertarget{conclusion-3}{%
\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-3}}

After looking at this on the staff, it is obvious that you can eliminate the
last arrangement, but how do you choose between the first two which both have
an outer interval of 7 (P5)? In pcs theory, the first tie-breaker is looking
at the distance between the lowest pitch and the second highest pitch. In the
above example, the second interval for the first arrangement is 5 (P4), but
the second interval for the second arrangement is only 2 (M2). In this case
the normal form this trichord is {[}0,2,7{]}.

\hypertarget{developing-a-method-for-normal-form}{%
\section{Developing a method for normal
form}\label{developing-a-method-for-normal-form}}

Let's try to create a step-by-step process for finding normal form by using a
more difficult example. The following pentachord has multiple ties and will
require you to work through multiple levels. Try to develop this method
without using a staff or clock faces. While working through this, how many
permutations in ascending order are there for a this set? How does that number
relate to the cardinality for any set? Remember that each tie is broken by
measuring the first pitch against the next closest pitch.

(3,e,5,2,8)

\hypertarget{conclusion-4}{%
\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-4}}

With a large set such as this pentachord, it is difficult to quickly parse the
normal form.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Put the pcs in an ascending form.} It does not matter on which pitch
  you start, only that the pitches are ascending. You can imagine this using a
  clock face--each pitch class must go in the order it would if you move
  clockwise around the clock without skipping any pitch classes. For this
  pentachord, let's start with:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    (2,3,5,8,e)
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{List every possible ascending arrangements of the pc set.} There
  will always be the same number of arrangements as there are members of the
  pc set, because each integer will have \emph{one} ascending arrangement with
  it as a starting pitch class. For a pentachord, there will always be five
  possibilities, and for this particular pc set, they are:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    (2,3,5,8,e)
  \item
    (3,5,8,e,2)
  \item
    (5,8,e,2,3)
  \item
    (8,e,2,3,5)
  \item
    (e,2,3,5,8)
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{Subtract the first number \emph{from} the last number for each
  ascending arrangement.} This will give you the interval between the outer
  pitch classes expressed as a number of half-steps. If the last number is
  smaller than the first number, you must use mod12 to convert it. For most
  students, it is easiest to add 12 to the smaller number before subtracting,
  but after you have practiced, you can apply this to the result if you'd
  like. For example above:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    (2,3,5,8,e) \textbar{} e-2 = 11-2 = \emph{9}
  \item
    (3,5,8,e,2) \textbar{} 2-3 (requires mod 12) = 14-3 = \emph{11}
  \item
    (5,8,e,2,3) \textbar{} 3-5 (requires mod 12) = 15-5 = \emph{10}
  \item
    (8,e,2,3,5) \textbar{} 5-8 (requires mod 12) = 17-8 = \emph{9}
  \item
    (e,2,3,5,8) \textbar{} 8-e (requires mod 12) = 20-11 = \emph{9}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{The normal form is the ascending arrangement with the smallest outer
  interval. If you have multiple arrangements with the same outer interval,
  you must proceed to the first tie-breaker.} In our above example, we have
  three options with an outer interval of 9 (M6). (At this point, we have
  eliminated the two arrangements that had the larger outer intervals of 10
  and 11.) We must compare each of the tied arrangements against each other to
  determine which example has the \emph{next} smallest outer interval. You can
  do this easily by subtracting the second-to-last number from the first
  number, so for our remaining three with the outer interval of 9, we get:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    (2,3,5,8,e) \textbar{} 8-2 = \emph{6}
  \item
    (8,e,2,3,5) \textbar{} 3-8 (requires mod12) = 15-8 = \emph{7}
  \item
    (e,2,3,5,8) \textbar{} 5-e (requires mod12) = 17-11 = \emph{6}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{If there is still a tie, repeat the process for the remaining
  ascending orders, but using the third-to-last pitch class for your
  subtraction.} Sometimes, this can move through multiple tie-breakers, so
  just continue moving inward through the arrangements. The previous example
  still had a tie between the first and last arrangement, so we have to go one
  last round:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    (2,3,5,8,e) \textbar{} 5-2 = \emph{3}
  \item
    (e,2,3,5,8) \textbar{} 3-e (requires mod12) = 15-11 = \emph{4}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{Once you have only one smallest interval, you have found the normal
  form for that pc set.} Remember that you must change your notation to
  include square brackets once you have determined normal form. For our
  example above, our normal form is:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    {[}2,3,5,8,e{]}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Note that there cannot be a definitive normal form for symmetrical sets such
as diminished seventh chords, augmented triads, and whole-tone scales. For
these, it is simplest to list the lowest integer first.

Near the beginning of the course, we familiarized ourselves with the common
scales necessary for learning diatonic function: major, natural minor, melodic
minor, harmonic minor, major pentatonic, minor pentatonic, and chromatic
scales. If you need to refresh your memory of those scales, please review Unit
2.

\hypertarget{non-diatonic-scales}{%
\section{Non-diatonic scales}\label{non-diatonic-scales}}

Most music--whether folk, pop, jazz, classical, etc.--can organize the pitches
into what you would identify as a scale, but in most of these styles, rarely
do these scales conform to a simple major or minor scale. Some of these
scales, like the various diatonic \emph{modes} and the pentatonic collection,
are relatively familiar to most listeners. Others--such as octatonic and whole
tone collections/scales--are more novel, and most often associated with
compositions of the last 100 years.

When characterizing scales, the word ``collection'' is often more appropriate
than ``scale.'' A \emph{collection} is any group of notes--usually five or
more--that can be ordered in an ascending and repeating fashion. Imagine a
collection as a source from which a composer can draw musical material--a kind
of ``soup'' within which pitch-classes float freely. Collections by themselves
do not imply a tonal center. But in a composition, a composer may establish a
tonal center by privileging one note of the collection, which we then call a
\emph{scale}.

\textbf{Use the following arrangements of \emph{Happy Birthday} to determine
the intervallic pattern of each of these scales/collections. After discussing
this with your group and writing the scale/collection out in standard
ascending form, practice transposing the scale into various keys to ensure
that you understand its structure. Finally, please read through the
descriptions on the following page for background and the common usage for
each of these scales/collections.}

We covered the standard major and minor pentatonic scales in Unit 2b, and you
hopefully can see how the Hirajoshi pentatonic scale combines aspects of both
standard Western pentatonic scales--the hirajoshi uses the scale degrees of
the major pentatonic but the accidentals from the natural minor scale.

The name clearly states this, but this scale is constructed entirely of major
seconds, and because it has six pitches, we call this a \emph{hexatonic}
scale. Interestingly, the whole tone scale is one of the few collections of
pitches that is both symmetrical and constructed entirely of one interval. It
shares this trait with a fully diminished seventh chord (all minor thirds) and
an augmented triad (all major thirds). Any whole tone scale also contains two
augmented triads, separated by a M2.

Because there are only six pitches, you will have to choose to insert a skip
of a diminished third when writing a whole tone scale on a staff, assuming
that you want to keep your tonic the same in every octave. If you stack only
use major seconds, your octave will be an enharmonic equivalent. There is no
preferred place to put the interval of a third; most people just place it
where it eliminates as many accidentals as possible.

The symmetry of the whole tone scale means that there are actually only two
unique whole tone collections, because you can use any pitch of a given whole
tone scale as a tonic. In this chart, you can see that for each of these two
collections, you can start on any pitch within the collection and create a
whole tone scale.

Its symmetry also contributes to the whole tone scale's general
malleability--when all pitches are equal, it is both easy to manipulate but
hard to solidify. It is often used in compositions to denote confusion or the
supernatural.

The other two hexatonic scales require a combination of two intervals, the
minor second and minor third. By alternating these intervals, you can create a
six-note scale which we will label as either a 1+3 hexatonic scale or a 3+1
hexatonic scale. Like the whole-tone scale, 1+3/3+1 hexatonic scales contain
two augmented triads, but in this case, the two triads are separated by a
minor second.

We always label these hexatonic scales by looking at the first two intervals
when the scale is written in \emph{ascending} form. This often confuses
students, because when you write this scale in descending form, the first
interval will be the opposite of the name. For example, look at the 1+3
hexatonic scale starting on C:

C-C\#-E-F-G\#-A-C

You can clearly see that this scale begins with a minor second and then
alternates with minor thirds. If you write it in descending form, however, the
first interval is a m3. To avoid this confusion, we will always label these
based on their ascending form.

3+1 and 1+3 hexatonic scales do not have symmetry as obvious as the whole tone
scale, but they do have strong symmetrical traits. There are only four unique
1+3/3+1 collections, because like the whole tone scale, each note of a given
collection can be used to form another hexatonic scale. For example, if we
examine the C 1+3 hexatonic scale above, you can see that this are also the
same pitches for the E 1+3, and G\# 1+3 scales. If you arrange this scale to
start on C\#, F, or A, you would create the 3+1 hexatonic scales for those
three pitches. This means that every collection contains three 1+3 and three
3+1 hexatonic scales.

The two variants of the octatonic scale, the half-whole and whole-half, are
similar to the 1+3/3+1 hexatonic scales in nearly every way. Both: - consist
of an alternating pattern of two intervals - contain two standard, symmetrical
chords separated by a half-step - can be transformed into another version of
the octatonic scale by reassigning tonic to any pitch in the collection

The differentiator between the two scales is the intervallic pattern. The
octatonic scale alternates between minor seconds and major seconds, as opposed
to the 1+3/3+1 hexatonic scales' minor seconds and minor thirds. The slightly
smaller interval pattern of the octatonic creates a collection of eight
pitches with many symmetrical properties. And like hexatonic scales, we will
always label an octatonic scale starting from its first interval \emph{in its
ascending form}, because in its descending form the pattern will be reversed.
If the first interval of your ocatonic scale is a minor second, you will label
this as a half-whole (HW) octatonic scale; if the first interval is a major
second, you will label this a whole-half (WH) octatonic scale.

You can divide any octatonic collection into two fully diminished seventh
chords, as demonstrated in the C Half-whole (HW) scale written out here.

C-C\#-Eb-E-F\#-G-A-Bb-C

You can see that this collection can be separated into a Co7 and a C\#o7 (If
you do not see this, make sure to consider all of the enharmonic equivalents).
And because a fully diminished seventh chord is symmetrical--as we discussed
when studying them for enharmonic modulations in Unit 20b--we can then infer
that this scale would have an identical interval pattern if we started on any
of the pitches of that diminished seventh chord. For example, if you rearrange
the collection to ascend from Eb, F\#, or A--the other members of the Co7--you
will find that the resulting scale is still alternating between minor seconds
and major seconds, just with a different tonic.

Also like the 1+3/3+1 hexatonic scales, if we start the scale from the other
pitches--for the C HW listed above, these would be the pitches of the other
diminished seventh chord, C\#, E, G, and Bb of the C\#o7--you create a scale
based on the \emph{other} octatonic scale pattern, the WH. Therefore, every
octatonic collection contains four HW octatonic scales and four WH octatonic
scales, which means that there are only three unique octatonic collections.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lllllllll@{}}
\toprule
The three octatonic collections & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
\midrule
\endhead
1 & C & Db & Eb & E & F\# & G & A & Bb \\
2 & C\# & D & E & F & G & Ab & Bb & B \\
3 & D & Eb & F & Gb & Ab & A & B & C \\
4 & Eb & E & F\# & G & A & Bb & C & Db \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

The octatonic scale has long been a favorite of modern composers, because it
not only has the tonal fluidity and symmetry of a hexatonic scales, but it
also contains many of standard tonal structures such as triads and seventh
chords. In a HW octatonic scale, you can create a major triad, minor triad,
diminished triad, minor seventh chord, dominant seventh chord, and fully
diminished seventh triad off of four of different pitches within the
collection. This gives composers an amazing flexibility to use tonally
familiar structures in a non-standard manner.

\section{Secondary dominant functions for chords other than
V}\label{secondary-dominant-functions-for-chords-other-than-v}}

At the end of the Unit 14a, you completed the process of transforming a ii7
chord into V7/V. In the final instructions, I suggested that you try altering
chords other than the ii chord to see if you could create secondary dominants
for chords other than V.

Let's work through this in the following example. Harmonize the progression in
four-part harmony; then alter chords to create secondary dominant chords. How
many options are possible if you only alter existing chords? Assuming that you
created a secondary dominant chord, try changing it into secondary
leading-tone chord.

The previous example has multiple chords that are connected by root movement
of a descending P5, which is the reason that it provides multiple
opportunities for secondary dominant chords. In the example below, you can see
the secondary chords next to their closely related diatonic counterparts. By
placing them next to each other, you can see not only how similar the
secondary dominant chords are to their diatonic counterparts, but it is also
easy to see that they share a function with the chord with the chord that
precedes them. This includes a secondary dominant chord that we had not looked
at yet: V7/ii. You will notice that this chord is as closely related to the
vi7 chord as the V7/V was related to the ii7 chord.

V}\label{tonicizing-chords-other-than-v}}

In music, secondary dominant functions can appear anywhere the composer would
like to emphasize a chord or prolong its function. \emph{Any major, minor, or
dominant quality can be tonicized.}

For secondary leading-tone chords: - For minor chords, you may use a V, a V7,
a viio, or a viio7. You may not use a viiø7 (half-diminshed seventh chord)
because the chordal seventh will sound strange. - For major and dominant
chords, you may use a V, a V7, a viio, \emph{viiø7, or a viio7}. Notice that
you may use either a fully diminished or half-diminished seventh chord, even
though the naturally-ocurring seventh chord built off the 7th scale degree in
a major key will always be a half-diminished chord. For tonicizing a major
chord, fully diminished chords actually appear more often than half-diminished
chords, because they further strengthen the voice-leading.

\hypertarget{altering-root-movement}{%

The following example uses a IV chord instead of a ii chord, and this changes
the root movement for much of the passage. Try adding secondary dominant or
leading-tone chords in the spots marked with an ``x.'' The note in the bass is
just a placeholder, so please feel free to change it. You should experiment
with various inversions to see if you can create more melodic bass lines as
well.

\hypertarget{conclusions-12}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-12}}

Your most straightforward option is to use root-position secondary dominant
functions in each spot creating a progression that would look something like
this:

The voice-leading is easy to determine as long as you follow the standard
resolutions for the tendency tones in each secondary dominant chord. In this
progression, you must alternate between complete and incomplete chords to
avoid objectional parallels.

There are countless other options you could use to embellish this progression
though. You probably noticed the disjunct bass line in the root-position
harmonization example, but the three upper voices had smooth voice-leading. By
using inversions of secondary dominant chords and/or secondary leading-tone
chords, you can create much more melodic bass lines. Take your previous
harmonization (or use the clean version below), and alter it by inserting
secondary dominant functions at each spot marked with an x. You should be able
to create an entirely stepwise bass line. Remember that if you need to change
the openness of a chord's voicing, it can be helpful to have one voice jump a
fourth by moving from the third of the first chord to the third of the second
chord.

\hypertarget{beginning-chromatic-harmony}{%
\section{Beginning chromatic harmony}\label{beginning-chromatic-harmony}}

This unit will be your first introduction of \emph{functional}
accidentals--meaning altered notes that are critical to the function of a
chord rather than embellishing non-chord tone accidentals of diatonic harmony.
So this marks the beginning of our studies of \emph{chromatic} harmony. As you
read on, remember that \emph{all} tonal harmony relates back to the function
and voice-leading that we established in studying diatonic harmony.

\hypertarget{introducing-secondary-dominant-chords}{%
\section{Introducing secondary dominant
chords}\label{introducing-secondary-dominant-chords}}

Secondary dominant chords are a logical extension to diatonic progressions and
an obvious starting point for studying chromatic harmony, because they are
simply an elaboration of circle-of-fifths progressions. Let's begin by
harmonizing the following progression in four-part harmony. Because it is full
of root position triads, you will need to use multiple incomplete chords to
use smooth voice-leading while avoiding errors.

\{\% capture ex1 \%\}X:1 T:A standard progression M:4/4 L:1/2 K:C Q:1/4=80 V:1

{[}C,2{]}\textbar{]} w:C:I vi ii V I\{\% endcapture \%\} \{\% include
abc-example.html number=``1'' abc=ex1 \%\}

In Unit 7, we discussed the evolution of the circle-of-fifths progression, and
in that process, we saw that the circle-of-fifths progressions are strong
because the voice-leading closely mirrors a series of V-I progressions. With
that in mind, let's zoom in on the middle measure of the ii-V-I progression
that you completed above. (This will work for any voicing that you chose, but
I have inserted the voicing that I used in the next example.) On the staff
below, I have isolated the ii and V chords in the first two measures. In the
second measure, I have copied all of the voices exactly from the first
measure, but I have altered only the \emph{key signature} to match the tonic
of the second chord--in this case, our second chord was the V chord, a G major
triad, so I used the key signature for G major without altering any of the
voices. Analyze the second measure in G major while taking into account the
new key signature. What progression have we created?

\{\% capture ex2 \%\}X:2 T:Altering ii-V M:4/4 L:1/2 K:C Q:1/4=80 V:1 {[}dF{]}

\{\% include abc-example.html number=``2'' abc=ex2 \%\}

As you can see, these two progressions are identical with the exception of one
accidental. The ii-V progression in C major has a weaker pull than the V-I
progression in G major, but they are functionally similar. Therefore, we could
strengthen the ii-V progression in C major by adding one accidental to the ii
chord to have it mimic the dominant chord in a secondary key. To try this,
take your completed progression from the first example above and alter the one
pitch necessary in the ii chord to ``borrow'' the dominant chord from G major.
(I have provided you with my voicing if you deleted yours, but feel free to
copy your voices into the appropriate lines of the ABC notation.)

\hypertarget{conclusion-5}{%
\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-5}}

To do this, you only need to raise the third of the ii chord to create a D
major triad--the V chord in the key of G major. This creates a temporary V
chord instead of a ii chord which you can hear by playing the following
example.

\hypertarget{tonicization-and-secondary-function}{%
\section{Tonicization and secondary
function}\label{tonicization-and-secondary-function}}

In this case, the progression is momentarily acting as if a non-tonic
chord--in this case, the V chord--\emph{has become} the tonic. We call this
\emph{tonicization}. It is the process of borrowing the dominant function from
a non-tonic chord's key to provide emphasis and prolong a chord's function.

Tonicization is a \emph{secondary function}. When studying function in
diatonic contexts we discussed the primary functions of tonic, dominant, and
pre-dominant, as well as tertiary functions such as cadential, passing, pedal,
and arpeggiated. Secondary function is yet another category of functions in
which the primary functions--i.e.~the tonic and dominant
relationship--\emph{of a second key} are used in our original key.

\hypertarget{labeling-secondary-dominant-chords}{%
\section{Labeling secondary dominant
chords}\label{labeling-secondary-dominant-chords}}

In the example above, the ii chord becomes a major chord once the sharp is
added, so it is no longer a ii chord. To denote this in our Roman numerals, we
use two Roman numerals separated by a slash: V/V. We read this as ``five of
five.'' In this labeling, the Roman numeral before the backslash is the
chord's function as if it were \emph{in the key of} the Roman numeral after
the slash. In our example above, the D minor chord becomes a D major chord, so
it now acts as the V chord in the key of G major: a ``five of five.''

One important note, standard practice for secondary function chords allows you
to tonicize any chord that is \emph{not} a diminished triad. This means that
viio in major and minor as well as iio in minor should not be tonicized.

Because we label secondary functions in Roman numerals using slashes, students
often confuse the function of the slash with leadsheet symbols. In leadsheet
symbols, a slash denotes an inversion to the chord by denoting which pitch is
in the bass voice, where in Roman numerals, we use \emph{inversion figures} to
denote the bass note. A slash in Roman numerals implies a secondary function
and tells you what key is being tonicized. While both systems are useful for
theorists, you must be careful not to let the nomenclature mix together.

\hypertarget{secondary-dominant-seventh-chords}{%
\section{Secondary dominant seventh
chords}\label{secondary-dominant-seventh-chords}}

In our progression above, what would happen if we had decided to use a ii7
chord instead of a ii chord? Try it on the following staff. Start by
harmonizing the ii7-V-I progression below while making sure that you resolve
your chordal thirds and sevenths correctly. Once you have a voicing that you
like, alter the ii7 chord using accidentals to create a V7 in the key of G
major -- a V7/V (read: ``five seven of five'')

\hypertarget{conclusion-6}{%
\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-6}}

When you alter the ii7 chord in the same way that you altered the ii triad to
create a secondary dominant, you create a secondary dominant seventh chord--in
this case, a V7/V.

There are many possibilities for using these beyond tonicizing V chords,
because any major or minor triad can be tonicized by a secondary dominant
seventh chord. Instead of altering the ii chord in the above progressions, try
altering the vi chord. What chord will it tonicize? Which accidentals will
need to be borrowed? What will you call it once you have altered it? We will
fully examine these ideas in Unit 15.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Now that you have some guidelines in the form of stylistic rules, let's begin
developing the process for composing your own part-writing. How would you go
about harmonizing the following melody in a four-part chorale style? Before
you begin, look at the example and make a list of all the things you would
need to do to harmonize this melody.

In no particular order, you will need to determine: - Harmonies - Harmonic
rhythm - Cadences - Bass lines - Inner voices - Texture

To this point in the course, we have discussed each of these, but you have
spent most of your assignments analyzing existing examples rather than
creating your own music.

\section{Two important concepts to review before
beginning}\label{two-important-concepts-to-review-before-beginning}}

After looking at the list of concepts that are needed to harmonize a melody,
you probably feel daunted and combining so many concepts into a single,
coherent piece of music. So instead of bringing in every nuance to start, I'd
like to draw your attention to two major concepts that will act as your
overarching guides for managing your melodic (horizontal) and harmonic
(vertical) choices.

\hypertarget{concept-1---manage-the-horizontal-aspect-through-melody-and-tendency-tones}{%
\subsection{CONCEPT 1 - Manage the horizontal aspect through melody and
tendency
tones}\label{concept-1---manage-the-horizontal-aspect-through-melody-and-tendency-tones}}

First, you should always prioritize making smooth, singable part in this
style. Your bass line will likely have more leaps, but the upper three voices
should predominantly use stepwise motion. Any leaps should be followed by
stepwise motion in the opposite direction.

In Unit 7a, we showed that by studying the voice-leading of a simple V (or V7)
to I progression, we can propose a broad set of voice-leading rules that
explain circle-of-fifths diatonicism. Specifically: - For chords that have
roots separated by a P5: - The \emph{seventh} of the first chord resolves to
the \emph{third} of the second chord. - the \emph{third} of the first chord
resolves to the \emph{root} of the second chord. - If both chords are in root
position, the bass voice moves from the \emph{root} of the first chord to the
\emph{root} of the next chord.

This is the beginning of a \emph{circle-of-fifths progression}: a progression
in which each chord root follows the circle of fifths.

\hypertarget{concept-2---manage-the-veritcal-aspect-through-stylistic-rules}{%
\subsection{CONCEPT 2 - Manage the veritcal aspect through stylistic
rules}\label{concept-2---manage-the-veritcal-aspect-through-stylistic-rules}}

Voice-leading governs the horizontal axis of music by shaping the melodies
within each voice, but we need some basic rules to guide the vertical stacking
of these melodies to make harmonies. A basic four-part chorale style employs
the following four rules to act as general guidelines as a framework for
combining voices.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Range

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Use the treble and bass staves as your guide.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Your soprano should sit between the bottom line of the treble clef staff
      to a ledger line above the treble clef staff.
    \item
      The alto voice can go as low two ledger lines below the treble clef
      staff and up to the top of the treble clef.
    \item
      The tenor voice will typically range from the middle of the bass clef
      staff to three ledger lines above the bass clef staff.
    \item
      The bass voice will range from the top of the bass clef staff to a
      ledger line below the bass clef staff.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Spacing

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Your upper three voices should never have more than an octave between
    adjacent voices. The soprano and tenor \emph{can} be more than an octave
    apart though.
  \item
    Your bass can be as more than an octave from the tenor.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Doubling

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If you need to double a pitch, you can double (or even triple!) the root
    of most chords, and you should generally avoid doubling the chordal third
    and seventh. You can omit the chordal fifth if necessary, but the other
    pitches cannot be omitted entirely.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Voice-crossing

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In your early attempts at part-writing, do not allow your voices to cross.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

As you started, you hopefully realized that you had to make some important
choices first such as choosing your key and cadences. By the end, you should
have created a process similar to the following.

\textbf{To harmonize a melody in a four-part chorale style, you should:} -
\textbf{Identify the key} - Look for melodic patterns, starting pitches, and
ending pitches for clues as to an implied key. - \textbf{Determine your
phrase} - For the excerpt below, you have little room for decision making, but
for a larger melody, try singing the phrase repeatedly and listen to your
natural inclination for breaths or pauses. - It can also be helpful to look
for spots in which the rhythm slows naturally. - \textbf{Choose a cadence} to
complete your phrase. - Refer to
\href{08-cadences-phrasing/a1-cadences.html}{Unit 8a} to review the types of
cadences. - \textbf{Create the rest of the diatonic progression} beginning on
tonic and ending with your cadence. (If not already provided.) - Beginning on
tonic will establish your key center. Refer to
\href{06-intro-harmonic/b1-diafuncvoicelead.html}{Unit 6b} for a review of the
three primary harmonic functions: tonic, dominant, and pre-dominant. - Refer
to \href{07-harmonic-functions/a1-diaprogcirclefifths.html}{Unit 7a} to
determine a functional harmonic progression. - \textbf{Compose a bass line}
based on your harmonization. - This will resemble 1:1 counterpoint, so you can
refer to \href{05-counterpoint-embell-shapes/b1-cantfirmand1st.html}{Unit 5b}.
- It is okay for the bass line to be more disjunct than the other voices, so
feel free to leave your chords in root position to make doubling simpler. -
You can alter one or more of these once you begin looking at how it interacts
with your melody. Contrary motion against the soprano line is less likely to
create issues. - \textbf{Fill in the alto and tenor voices.} - Refer to the
guidelines for voicing, range, and doubling in
\href{10-intro-harmonic/a1-voiceleadingerrors.html}{Unit 10a}. - When writing
your parts, always \textbf{strive to have voice-leading that is as smooth as
possible} by emphasizing stepwise motion. - As mentioned above, bass lines are
the exception and will often have more leaps, especially when using
root-position chords. - \textbf{Check your work} - Listen to your finished
phrase repeatedly. It doesn't matter whether you play your phrase on piano or
via musical notation software; it only matters that you listen to it. -
Analyze your chorale for part-writing errors using the system we discussed in
Unit 10. - Does your phrase sound convincing when played? If not, restructure
your harmony and try again.

\section{Moving forward}\label{moving-forward}}

Please do not be afraid of failing! This is a normal and important part of the
learning process, so rather than be disappointed, try focusing on the parts
that you do not like, and then analyze them for errors. Your first attempts
may sound clunky and unconvincing, but you should be able to use the
analytical tools that you have developed thus far to find mistakes. Iteration
is key.

As you move the list above, you should realize that a four note melody such as
this leaves little room for development, so it is easiest to stick with a
simple ideas. Because \texttt{C} is in prominent positions at the beginning
and end of the example, use C major for your key. And since the melody ends on
the tonic, an authentic cadence would be easiest. With those two decisions
made, everything else begins to fall into place.

To keep this simple, let's choose a perfect authentic cadence. This locks in
the bass line for our last two notes, because we know that a PAC has a root
position V and I chords at the end of the phrase. It is hopefully clear that
the first pitch should start on the tonic chord to establish the key in our
ear, which leaves only the second chord undetermined.

Because the chord that \emph{follows} our undetermined chord is a dominant
chord, it makes sense to use a pre-dominant chord, and the \texttt{A} in the
melody would allow for either a ii chord or a IV chord. (If you are struggling
to remember the standard diatonic chord progressions, please refer to Refer to
\href{07-harmonic-functions/a1-diaprogcirclefifths.html}{Unit 7a}.)Let's
choose an inverted ii chord to provide some variety.

You now can refer to the handout to see if we met some basic criteria: - Our
chords follow a standard progression. - It establishes a key and then cadences
in that key. - The lines emphasize smooth voice-leading.

We are now ready to add inner voices, and we can use our voicing and doubling
rules from Unit 6b to establish a first chord.

And lastly, we can create the alto and tenor lines while observing the melodic
guidelines from the handout. - Individual lines should create smooth
voice-leading using primarily stepwise motion. - Resolve tendency tones as we
studied in our voice-leading discussions (Unit 6b.)

Of note, you may have tried to jump to a \texttt{D} for the first beat of the
second measure in the tenor line, but this creates an unnecessarily disjunct
tenor part. As we studied in Unit 6b, the chordal fifth can be ommitted on a
seventh chord if the root is doubled.

Therefore, if we use only the tools that we have developed thus far in the
course, we can already create a simple four-part chorale.

Now that we have a functional understanding of diatonic harmony, we can begin
analyzing scores that use instruments other than voice or piano, but to so,
you will need to understand how to read music composed for transposing
instruments.

\hypertarget{terminology}{%
\chapter{Terminology}\label{terminology}}

For various practical and historical reasons, \emph{transposing instruments}
produce a different sounding pitch than the one written on the page. For
example, when a B-flat clarinet sees a written `C,' that pitch will sound as a
`B-flat.'

Musicians use the following terms to discuss transposing instruments. -
\emph{sounding pitch} - The pitch that an instrument produces, regardless of
its standard transposition. - \emph{written pitch} - The pitch as written on
the music. - \emph{concert pitch} - The pitch at which the note name matches
the standard frequencies for that pitch. (i.e.~C = C, A = A, etc.) - In
practical usage, concert pitch is almost always interchangeable with sounding
pitch.

Transposing instruments are not conceptually difficult to understand--these
instruments sound at a different pitch than written--but in practice, it often
confuses students because instrument transposition is the process by which we
\emph{compensate} for an instrument's sounding pitch. If we write for a B-flat
instrument, it sounds a whole-step \emph{lower}, so we must write the part a
whole-step \emph{higher} to get the performer to sound the correct pitch.
Conversely, when reading a B-flat transposed part, we must read it a
whole-step lower for concert pitch, because it is written a whole-step higher
than sounding.

It is easy to transpose in the wrong direction when having to constantly flip
back and forth between concert pitch and the transpositions, so it is
important to have a complete understanding of transposition for each
instrument. Luckily, they can be grouped into relatively few categories.

\hypertarget{ranges}{%
\chapter{Ranges}\label{ranges}}

First, it is helpful to discuss the standard ranges of the instruments while
looking at the transpositions. If you can remember that a tenor saxophone has
a range similar to a tenor voice, this makes it considerably easier to
remember the direction and distance required for its transposition.

Instrument and voice ranges are self-explanatory, but there are a variety of
caveats that affect the extremes for almost every instrument. Brass players
and vocalists, for example, have a \emph{wide} variation of how high or low an
individual can comfortably perform depending on the experience of the
performer. Some instruments can be physically altered such as the bassoon,
double bass, and piano to add more range. Because of this variation as well as
the constantly evolving standards of instrument construction and performance
standards, you should always research an instrument before you choose to
compose for it. While the internet is full of great resources--such as the
link below--the best research for understanding an instrument is to discuss
the instrument with expert performers. Even with good references such as the
one below, it is not able to show the nuances of each instrument. (For
example, this sheet does not show the common range extension techniques and
tools such as the low C extension for double bass, the use of piccolo trumpet,
or altissimo for woodwinds.)

\hypertarget{range-and-transposition-handout}{%
\chapter{Range and transposition

For our part-writing, we will use the basic ranges from this helpful resource
compiled by Dr.~BJ Brooks.

\href{http://octatone.com/orchestral-ranges-transposition/}{Orchestral

NOTE: There is a small mistake on the part for the double bass; the top note
(D) is missing a tenor clef.

The ranges on this sheet are the \textbf{written ranges} for each of the
instruments. If you want to find the sounding range, you will need to apply
the transpositions that follow each staff. Read more about this below.

You may print this page for easy reference.

\hypertarget{clefs}{%
\chapter{Clefs}\label{clefs}}

While not directly related to transpositions, some instruments commonly read
alternate clefs to lessen the number of ledger lines necessary. These include:
- viola (default is alto clef, can switch to treble if necessary) - cello
(default is bass clef, often switches to tenor (or even treble!)when
necessary) - bassoon (default is bass clef, often switches to tenor when
necessary) - French horn (default is treble clef, but occasionally can switch
to any other clef if the part goes low enough into their pedal register) -
trombone (default is bass clef, often switches to tenor when necessary)

\hypertarget{terminology-confusion}{%
\subsection{Terminology confusion}\label{terminology-confusion}}

Before going further, please make sure that you understand the above
definitions and usage for the terms \emph{sounding} pitch, \emph{concert}
pitch, and \emph{written} pitch.

One of the most confusing elements of understanding transposing instruments is
the use of key names to describe the instruments. If an instrument is ``in
B-flat'' as described above, that implies that the instrument reads parts that
are written a M2 away from concert pitch. Unfortunately, this creates the
possibility of confusing statements such as, ``For a trumpet in B-flat, the
key of A-flat is actually B-flat.'' This ambiguity should be clarified by
differentiating between the instrument's transposition and the key signature
in which the piece is composed: ``For a trumpet {[}that sounds{]} in B-flat,
the {[}concert key signature{]} of A-flat \protect\hyperlink{major}{major} is
{[}written{]} as B-flat \protect\hyperlink{major}{major}.'' The language we
use in this instance is clunky at best, inadequate at worst. It falls upon the
musician to make sure that they are communicating clearly when it comes to
transposing instruments.

\hypertarget{non-transposing-instruments-in-c}{%
\subsection{Non-transposing instruments (in
C)}\label{non-transposing-instruments-in-c}}

Non-transposing instruments are the easiest to understand, because they read
and sound at the pitch written. This group includes: - voice - piano - violin
- viola - cello - flute - oboe - bassoon - trombone (alto, tenor, and bass) -
See the section below on the history of brass instruments for details. -
euphonium/baritone - tuba - See the section below on the history of brass
instruments for details. - harp

\hypertarget{octave-displacing-instruments}{%
\subsection{Octave displacing
instruments}\label{octave-displacing-instruments}}

Some instruments read in concert pitch, but sound in a different octave. This
is done to limit the number of ledger lines necessary to write their parts.
This group includes: - piccolo (sounds up an octave from written) - bass flute
(sounds down an octave from written) - contrabassoon (sounds down an octave
from written) - guitar (sounds down an octave from written) - double bass
(sounds down an octave from written)

\hypertarget{instruments-written-in-b-flat}{%
\subsection{Instruments written in
B-flat}\label{instruments-written-in-b-flat}}

You can find the concert pitch for all B-flat instruments by transposing
\emph{down} a M2 from the the written pitch. \textbf{This does not necessarily
give you the correct octave}--just the correct pitch--so you must then
consider the distance and direction based on the specific instrument.

Instruments in B-flat include many of the most common ``band'' instruments.
This group includes: - Clarinet in B-flat (sounds down a M2 from written) -
Bass clarinet in B-flat (sounds down a M9--or a M2 plus an octave--from
written) - Bass clarinet adds an extra octave below the standard B-flat
transposition. All clarinets read from treble clef music, so when accounting
for the extra octave that the bass clarinet adds, it is easiest to switch to
bass clef when writing this instrument in concert pitch. - Trumpet in B-flat
(sounds down a M2 from written) - See section below on the history of brass
instruments for a discussion of other common trumpets and their usage. -
Soprano saxophone (sounds down a M2 from written) - Tenor saxophone (sounds
down a M9--or a M2 plus an octave--from written) - The lower voiced saxophones
(tenor and baritone) add an extra octave below the standard transposition. All
saxophones read from treble clef music, so to account for the extra octave
when writing in concert pitch, it is easiest to switch to bass clef for this
instrument.

Conveniently, no B-flat instruments sound higher than their written pitch, so
for each of the above instruments, when reading their written parts, transpose
\emph{down} a M2 to find concert pitch, although you must add the additional
octave for tenor saxophone.

When reading a concert pitch line, transpose \emph{up} a M2 to write for a
B-flat instrument. Do not forget the additional octave for bass clarinet and
tenor saxophone.

\hypertarget{instruments-written-in-e-flat}{%
\subsection{Instruments written in
E-flat}\label{instruments-written-in-e-flat}}

You can find the concert pitch for all E-flat instruments by transposing
\emph{up} a m3 or \emph{down} a M6 from than the written pitch. \textbf{This
does not necessarily give you the correct octave}--just the correct pitch--so
you must then consider the distance and direction based on the specific
instrument.

This group includes: - Clarinet in E-flat (sounds up a m3 from written) - Alto
saxophone (sounds down a M6 from written) - Baritone saxophone (sounds down a
M13--or a M6 plus an octave--from written) - The lower voiced saxophones
(tenor and baritone) add an extra octave below the standard transposition. All
saxophones read from treble clef music, so to account for the extra octave
when writing in concert pitch, it is easiest to switch to bass clef for this
instrument.

When reading an E-flat clarinet part, transpose a m3 \emph{up} to find concert
pitch. When reading an alto or baritone saxophone part, transpose a M6
\emph{down} to find concert pitch, although you must add the additional octave
for baritone saxophone.

When reading a concert pitch line, transpose \emph{down} a m3 to write for
E-flat clarinet. When reading a concert pitch line, transpose \emph{up} a M6
to write for alto or baritone saxophone. Do not forget to add an additional
octave for baritone saxophone.

\hypertarget{instruments-written-in-f}{%
\subsection{Instruments written in F}\label{instruments-written-in-f}}

You can find the concert pitch for all F instruments by transposing
\emph{down} a P5 from the written pitch. Conveniently, this will give you the
correct pitch \emph{and} octave for both of these instruments.

Both of the ``horns'' are written in F. This includes: - English horn - French
horn - See section below on the history of brass instruments for a discussion
of the many keys in which hornists are required to perform. - Many modern
hornists prefer to refer to French horn simply as ``horn.''

When reading an an English horn or French horn part, transpose \emph{down} a
P5 to find concert pitch.

When reading a concert pitch line, transpose \emph{up} a P5 to write for
either English horn or French horn.

\hypertarget{other-transposing-instruments}{%
\subsection{Other transposing
instruments}\label{other-transposing-instruments}}

Almost all instruments fall into the above categories, but there are two
outliers.

Clarinet in A is the only instrument that has a standard transposition in A.
(Trumpet and French horn parts are occasionally written in A as well. See the
section below on the history of brass instruments for more details.) To find
concert pitch from a part in A, transpose \emph{down} a m3 from the written
pitch. To write in this transposition, you should write \emph{up} a m3 from
concert pitch. Students often confuse these transpositional directions with
the more common E-flat instruments, because they are opposites.

Alto flute is the only instrument that has a standard transposition in G.
(French horn parts are occasionally written in G as well. See the section
below on the history of brass instruments for more details.) To find concert
pitch from a part in G, transpose \emph{down} a P4 from the written pitch. To
write in this transposition, you should write \emph{up} a P5 from concert
pitch. Students often confuse these transpositional directions with the more
common F instruments, because they are exact opposites.

\hypertarget{a-brief-history-on-brass-instrument-writing}{%
\section{A brief history on brass instrument
writing}\label{a-brief-history-on-brass-instrument-writing}}

\hypertarget{high-brass}{%
\subsubsection{High brass}\label{high-brass}}

Brass instrument transpositions often confuse students, because they evolved
into their modern forms at a later date than many of the other instruments.
This means that depending on the era in which a piece was composed, there are
a wide variety of ``keys'' in which the part might be written.

Early versions of both of the high brass instruments, trumpet and French horn,
could only play pitches from the natural overtone series of their instruments
which meant that early versions of these instruments were not fully chromatic.
To compensate, composers would write the part ``in X,'' in order to show the
performer which ``key'' their instrument needed to be in to play the part.
Simply put, the performer had to change instruments every time that they
changed keys. The practice of writing various transpositions for these two
instruments lasted throughout the 20th century--long after both of these
instruments became fully chromatic through the addition of valves--because of
competing standards in which key the instrument would be tuned.

Modern professional trumpeters and hornists are masters of transposition. They
choose the instrument on which they will perform based on timbral
characteristics of each instrument, regardless of the transposition chosen by
the composer. Modern trumpeters commonly use instruments pitched in B-flat, C,
D, E-flat, and A and sometimes even F and G. Modern horns are built to include
the standard F ``side'' of the horn, but by pressing a valve down they can
switch to a B-flat ``side'' on a double horn, or even an E-flat or F (up an
octave) ``side'' on a triple horn. You will encounter all of these
transpositions when reading scores. If you are writing a modern \emph{band}
piece, it is common practice to write the trumpet parts in B-flat and horn
parts in F. If you are writing a modern orchestral piece, it is simplest to
just write trumpet parts in C and horn parts in F. The performer will decide
which instrument, although if you desire a specific trumpet (e.g.~cornet,
flugelhorn, piccolo trumpet, etc.), you should ask a professional which
transposition will work best.

\hypertarget{low-brass}{%
\subsubsection{Low brass}\label{low-brass}}

Luckily, all of the low brass instruments read in concert pitch, so writing
for them is relatively simple. However, do not be confused when trombonists
talk about their instrument as a B-flat instrument. The fundamental of the
trombone is a concert B-flat, but it \emph{always} reads from parts written in
C. It is a non-transposing instrument.

The tuba often confuses students for the same reason. Tubists have a variety
of tubas from which to choose, including instruments with fundamentals at
B-flat, C, E-flat, and F. This does not change the key in which the tubists
read; their parts should always be in concert pitch. Instead, they learn a new
set of ``fingerings'' for each instrument. Note that this is opposite from how
trumpets and horns approach transposition.

Before you begin, please remember that this unit is not meant to be a formal
introduction to counterpoint. Because this is primarily a tonal harmony
course, we are briefly dipping into the study of counterpoint to introduce
voice-leading in its simplest form. I highly encourage you to study
counterpoint fully at a later time (if you have not already), because it will
change for the better the the manner in which you listen to, study, and
perform music.

To begin studying basic counterpoint, we need to establish the fundamental
concepts of intervallic consonance, intervallic dissonance, and the types of
contrapuntal motion.

\hypertarget{goals-for-this-topic-1}{%

    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Students familiar with modern music are often surprised to find that a perfect
4th is considered dissonant in this style. The first thing to understand is
that the terms \emph{consonant} and \emph{dissonant} are subjective terms that
are determined within a style. In this case, a perfect 4th undermines the
melodic structure of tonality because it implies a weak inversion. Complete
understanding of this idea requires a deeper knowledge of counterpoint and
implied harmony, so at this point, I ask that you file this away for us to
discuss when we get to tonal implications and usage of second inversion chords
in Unit 7.

\hypertarget{contrapuntal-motion}{%
\subsection{Contrapuntal motion}\label{contrapuntal-motion}}

At its most basic, classifying contrapuntal motion is fairly simple to
understand. When we compare two melodic lines, there are five types of
possible motion: - \textbf{parallel} - two lines that move in the same
direction and have the same interval \emph{size} - \textbf{similar} - both
lines move in the same direction but have different interval sizes -
\textbf{contrary} - two lines that move in opposite directions -
\textbf{oblique} - one line stays the same and the other line moves in any
direction - \textbf{static} - neither line moves - static motion supercedes
parallel motion

Each of these types of motion compares the direction of each line
(i.e.~ascending and descending) and the size of the interval.

\emph{NOTE: The full descriptions below of each type of non-chord tone are
from the online textbook, \href{http://www.openmusictheory.com}{Open Music
Theory}, although each has been edited to suit this textbook's terminology and
purpose. If you have not had a chance to check out Open Music Theory in the
Further Reading sections from the previous units, please take the time to do
so. It is an excellent resource!}

\hypertarget{chord-tones-versus-non-chord-tones-ncts}{%
\section{Chord tones versus non-chord tones
(NCTs)}\label{chord-tones-versus-non-chord-tones-ncts}}

To this point in our harmonic analyses, we have looked at mostly simple
textures that utilized steady, blocked chords. To make music varied and
interesting, however, we need to be able to create a variety of melodic shapes
and motives, and this requires using a mixture of pitches that are
functional--meaning that they are part of the harmony--and non-functional
embellishments. We call these embellishing pitches \emph{non-chord tones
(NCT)}, and understanding which pitches are functional is often the most
difficult hurdle in harmonic analysis.

Much like determining the harmonic rhythm, finding NCTs can be difficult
because it requires you to work through all possible combinations of the
pitches within a given harmony and then choose the most likely combination.
Even if you know that the harmony spans only two beats, it can be difficult to
sort through all the possible combinations if the texture is complicated.
Fortunately, the same strategies that work for determining the harmonic rhythm
provide a foundation for determining NCTs. You can begin by looking at melodic
patterns and bass-lines, and it is helpful to consider whether a note occurs
in a strong or weak metric position. It is unusual for the functional tones to
occur \emph{only} on offbeats, as the ear is drawn to pitches when they occur
on the beat.

Even for one experienced in finding patterns within the music, this still
sometimes requires trial-and-error. When first learning how to identify
non-chord tones, you may want to copy and rearrange the pitches on another
staff (or lightly next to the chord if there is room,) to see what triads and
seventh chords are even possible given the present notes. Usually this is
enough to limit the possibilities to one or two chords. When it is not, you
will then need to refer to your harmonic flowchart to see if there is some
context that could provide a probable chord.

\hypertarget{discussing-and-labeling-non-chord-tones}{%
\section{Discussing and labeling non-chord
tones}\label{discussing-and-labeling-non-chord-tones}}

When developing a harmonic analysis, you should place parentheses around the
note head of each non-chord tone and then label the NCT with its abbreviation.
Each of the non-chord tones below will have a standard abbreviation written
next to the definition. (For example, passing tones will be labeled using a
``pt.'')

Although before we can find non-chord tones in music, we need a shared
terminology that describes how they are constructed. There are a great variety
of NCTs, but every type shares a basic framework that we classify by motion
between the notes on either side of it. - the \emph{preparation} - The chord
tone that directly precedes the NCT. - Its relationship to the NCT will define
the type of movement used to approach the NCT. - the \emph{non-chord tone} -
The NCT must not belong to the chord. This should be obvious given the name,
but this is the most common mistake that students make when labeling NCTs. -
the \emph{resolution} - The chord tone that immediately follows the NCT. - Its
relationship to the NCT will define the type of movement used to leave the
NCT.

And while these three terms provide a framework through which we can classify
the movement of all non-chord tones, there are other aspects of their function
and characteristics that we may need to discuss. - Accented vs unaccented - An
accented NCT occurs in a strong metric position (``on the beat''). - An
unaccented NCT occurs in a weak metric position (``off the beat''). - On-chord
vs off-chord - An on-chord NCT coincides with a change of harmony. - An
off-chord NCT does not coincide with a change of harmony. - Chromatic vs
diatonic - Diatonic NCTs use only the notes present in the key-signature
whereas chromatic NCTs have an accidental. - As per usual, we will consider
the leading tone in a minor key as diatonic. - All types of NCTs can be either
chromatic or diatonic, although some are extremely rare (such as a chromatic
suspension). - Ascending vs descending (\emph{passing tones only}) - This
describes the direction created by the passing tone when combined with the
chord tones on either side. - Upper vs lower (\emph{neighbor tones only}) -
Neighbor tones can be divided into two categories based on whether they are
above or below the chord tone that they are embellishing.

One note on these labels: Because some methods for musical analysis only focus
on music of certain periods (e.g.~the Classical era), they may be overly
specific in describing certain non-chord tones in a way that does not fully
address the nature of the non-chord tone. For example, some texts say that
suspensions must be accented, but because accented refers to a metric position
(`on' or `off' the beat) rather than a harmonic position, this is not always
true in later styles. This is likely always true in the music of Mozart or
even Beethoven, but it is not always true for the music of Gustav Mahler or
John Lennon. It would be better to say that suspensions are always
\emph{on-chord}, because this allows for a suspension to happen in a weaker
metric position. Harmony and rhythm exist independently, so we should use
labels that help us understand all types of tonal music.

\hypertarget{conclusions-16}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-16}}

When we analyze non-chord tones, we \emph{label} a single pitch that does not
belong to the chord, however, we are actually \emph{classifying} the motion
between the non-chord tone and its surrounding pitches, and you can see this
in these straightforward definitions: - A \emph{passing tone} (PT) is a
non-chord tone which is approached by step and left by step in the same
direction. - A \emph{neighbor tone} (NT) is a non-chord tone which is
approached by step and left by step in the opposite direction. - A
\emph{suspension} (SUS) is a non-chord tone which is approached by static
motion and resolves downward by step.

Let's look at each of these in more detail. The following descriptions are
lightly edited versions taken from \emph{Open Music Theory}.

\hypertarget{passing-tone-pt}{%
\subsubsection{Passing tone (pt)}\label{passing-tone-pt}}

\includegraphics{images/embellishingTones/passingTone.png}

A passing tone is a melodic embellishment that occurs between two stable
tones, creating stepwise motion. \emph{It is approached by stepwise motion and
left by stepwise motion in the same direction.} A passing tone can be either
accented or unaccented as well as on-chord or off-chord.

The typical figure is \emph{chord tone -- passing tone -- chord tone}, filling
in a third (see example), but multiple adjacent passing tones can also be used
to fill in the space between two chord tones, and these would be labeled by
their number as appropriate--\emph{double passing tone (dpt), triple passing
tone (tpt), or quadruple passing tone (qpt)}. The only time you can have a
\emph{diatonic} double passing tone is between the chordal fifth and root of a
triad (e.g.~sol-(la-ti)-do within a I chord). You can have a double passing
tone to fill in a third if there are chromatic tones, and all triple and
quadruple passing tones require chromatic pitches.

\hypertarget{neighbor-tone-nt}{%
\subsubsection{Neighbor tone (nt)}\label{neighbor-tone-nt}}

\includegraphics{images/embellishingTones/neighborTone.png}

Like the passing tone, a neighbor tone is a melodic embellishment that occurs
between two stable tones; however, a neighbor tone occurs between two
instances of the same stable tone. \emph{It is approached by stepwise motion
and left by stepwise motion in the opposite direction.} Also like the passing
tone, movement from the stable tone to the neighbor tone and back will always
be by step. A neighbor tone can be either accented or unaccented, but
unaccented is more common. It can also be either on-chord or off-chord.

\hypertarget{suspension-sus}{%
\subsubsection{Suspension (sus)}\label{suspension-sus}}

\includegraphics{images/embellishingTones/suspension.png}

A suspension is formed of three critical parts: the \emph{preparation}
(accented or unaccented), the \emph{suspension} itself (accented), and the
\emph{resolution} (unaccented). The preparation is a chord tone (consonance).
The suspension is \emph{the same note} as the preparation and \emph{will
always be on-chord}, \textbf{which means that all suspensions require two
chords}, because the preparation will be on a different chord than the NCT
itself. The suspension then resolves downward by step to the resolution, which
occurs over the same harmony as the suspension.

Of note, it is a common misconception among students that a suspension is only
present if you see a \emph{tied} note. This is not true; the tone can be
re-articulated. It only needs to follow the pattern of - chord tone
-\textgreater{} non-chord tone approached by static motion on a new chord
-\textgreater{} resolution within the same chord

The suspension is in many respects the opposite of an anticipation (see the
next topic, Unit 9b); if the anticipation is an early arrival of a tone
belonging to the following chord, a suspension is a lingering of a chord tone
belonging to the previous chord that forces the late arrival of the new
chord's chord tone. However, in composition and improvisation, the suspension
must be treated with a great deal more care than an anticipation. The most
common suspensions (and their resolutions) in upper voices form the following
intervallic patterns against the bass: 9--8, 7--6, 4--3. (With the exception
of 9--8, the pitch class of the resolution tone should never sound in another
voice simultaneous with the suspended tone.)

Because suspensions can take many forms, we apply intervallic labels. When the
suspension is in an upper voice, we always label the intervals of the
suspension and its resolution against the \emph{bass} meaning that the
intervals will move from large to small (e.g.~4-3, 7-6, 9-8, etc.). When a
suspended note is in the bass voice, however, we label the intervals against
the most dissonant interval which means that the intervals will move from
small to large (e.g.~2-3). When you measure a downward resolution in an upper
voice against a lower voice, the intervals get smaller as the upper voice
moves \emph{closer} to the bass. When you measure a downward resolution
against a higher voice, the intervals get larger as the bass moves \emph{away}
from the upper voice.

Of note, because we use the most dissonant voice to label suspensions in the
bass, you will use the ``2-3'' label in the vast majority of this type of
suspension. These intervals will be present for suspensions resolving to
either the root or chordal third as long as the chord is complete. You are
unlikely to encounter a suspension above a chordal fifth in the bass because
of the usage rules of second inversion chords, and a suspension above the
chordal seventh would just be the root of the chord--meaning that it is not a
non-chord tone.

The most common suspensions are the 4-3, 7-6, 9-8 (2-1), and 2-3 suspensions,
but others can and do occur regularly.

\subsection{Conclusion (RET)}\label{conclusion-ret}}

\includegraphics{images/embellishingTones/retardation.png}

A retardation is essentially an upward-resolving suspension. It is almost
always reserved for the final chord of a large formal division (or a
movement), and it frequently appears simultaneously with a suspension (as seen
in the picture above). Like suspensions, retardations must be accented and
on-chord, yet unlike suspensions, it is not necessary to label the intervals
against the bass, although you may do so if you wish.

\hypertarget{a-few-last-notes}{%
\section{A few last notes}\label{a-few-last-notes}}

There are four other standard non-chord tones that we will discuss in the next
topic, but we should clear up some common questions before moving on.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  First, some non-chord tones can occur within a single harmony \emph{or}
  across two harmonies, meaning the preparation, NCT, and resolution are
  contained within one chord or spread across two. But other NCTs are
  restricted to one or the other. For example, a passing tone can be either
  within a single chord or spanning two chords, but suspensions and
  retardations can \emph{only} happen across two chords; it is not possible to
  have suspension or retardation within a single chord. Any NCT with
  restrictions such as this will be noted in their descriptions, and it is
  imperative that you learn the context for each of the non-chord tones, so
  that you can quickly identify these issues.
\item
  Once we have discussed all nine of the standard NCTs, you will be able to
  describe and analyze almost any combination of melodic intervals as they
  pertain to tonal harmony. Generally speaking, if you cannot come up with an
  analysis of a melody that accounts for each NCT into one of the nine
  categories, that means that you likely analyzed the harmonies incorrectly.
  As with even the most consistent of musical ideas, there will be occasional
  exceptions, but understanding your NCTs will be one of the easiest ways for
  you to make your analyses more effecient and effective.
\item
  As we learn each of these non-chord tones, you will begin to notice these
  patterns in music, even when no NCT is present. If you would like to use a
  motion description for a chord tone, such as passing or neighbor, you can
  replace the word \emph{tone} with the word \emph{figure}. So a ``passing
  figure'' is a pitch that is approached by step and left by step in the same
  direction, but all three of the pitches that make up the preparation,
  passing tone, and resolution are chord tones.
\item
  One of the most common questions about non-chord tones is whether a pitch
  should be written as a passing tone or a chordal seventh. For example, in
  the progression below, we have an imperfect authentic cadence, that starts
  as a simple triad, but then the alto voice moves to \texttt{fa} which could
  be analyzed as either a passing tone or a chordal seventh. So which would
  you choose? Is this a V chord with a passing tone or is this a V7 chord with
  no non-chord tones?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In this particular case, I would consider \texttt{fa} as part of the chord,
  because it is functioning as a chordal seventh. The chordal seventh is a
  tendency tone that typically resolves downward by step, and it is doing so
  here. If it resolved in another way (e.g.~up by step), it might be a melodic
  passing tone and would therefore be not functional.
\end{itemize}

abc-example.html number=``4'' abc=ex4 \%\}

Regardless of whether you include the pitch as functional, the NCTs must
always match the Roman numeral. In this scenario, if you choose to include the
chordal seventh in your harmony, you only need to write the proper Roman
numeral and inversion figure. If, however, you decide that the chordal seventh
is just a passing tone, you must label it as a non-chord tone and write only
\texttt{V} for the Roman numeral.

\hypertarget{a-final-reminder}{%
\section{A final reminder!}\label{a-final-reminder}}

As we first begin to study non-chord tones, the most important thing to
remember is what the name ``non-chord tone'' emphasizes. \textbf{NCTs must not
belong to the chord.} This is one of the most common mistakes for beginning
analysts.

\hypertarget{a-starting-place}{%
\subsection{A Starting Place}\label{a-starting-place}}

In this course, we will be studying many styles of music, but all of these
will have roots in the harmonic and melodic practices of the common practice
period. The common practice period is generally considered to include Western
art music from the Renaissance through the Romantic eras, but any music that
that grew out of this tradition--including almost all popular music today--can
be analyzed using the tools we will study for common practice harmony.

By the time musicians begin formally exploring music theory, they likely are
familiar with basic music notation--treble and bass clefs, staves, ledger
lines, and accidentals--due to time spent performing. If you are uncomfortable
with any of aspect of these concepts, you can review by reading the
explanations under the \emph{Further Reading} section of
\href{01-pitches-clefs/a2-pitchesclefs.html}{Discussion 1a}.

\hypertarget{clefs-1}{%
\section{Clefs}\label{clefs-1}}

Even though most college music students are familiar with reading music, most
are partial to the clef associated with their primary instrument or
voice-part. It is vital that musicians be fluent in not only the two most
common clefs--treble and bass--but also with two additional clefs: alto clef
and tenor clef. Alto and tenor clefs are often used by instruments such as
viola, cello, trombone, and bassoon. They alleviate the use of ledger lines in
the extreme registers of an instrument and appear regularly in even the most
elementary music.

\hypertarget{exploring-clefs}{%
\subsection{Exploring clefs}\label{exploring-clefs}}

Treble clef is sometimes referred to as a \emph{G-clef}, and bass clef can be
called an \emph{F-clef}. Alto and tenor clefs are known as \emph{C-clefs}. So
let's piece together the notes and octave relationships between the clefs as
well as why the clefs have these alternate names.

In the examples below: - the treble and alto clefs are in unison - the tenor
and bass clefs are in unison - the treble/alto clefs are separated from the
the tenor/bass clefs by one octave - middle C rests on the first ledger line
below the treble clef staff

Knowing this, use these examples to find: - the order of pitch names for each
clef's lines and spaces. - why treble clef is a G-clef, why bass clef is an
F-clef, and why alto and tenor clefs are C-clefs. - where middle C is on each
clef. - any tips or tricks that may help in differentiating and reading clefs.

\hypertarget{conclusion-7}{%
\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-7}}

Clefs have secondary names because each clef is centered around the pitch in
its name. The bass clef's dots surround an F, and the two C-clefs are centered
on middle C. Treble clef, however, not only encircles the G at the center of
its spiral, but it evolved from a stylized \emph{G}. For a well-researched,
short article on the evolution of clefs, I suggest reading Jimmy Stamp's
\href{http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-evolution-of-the-treble-clef-87122373/}{The
Evolution of the Treble Clef} from the Smithsonian website.

The octave relationship for each clef is the most important thing you can
remember from this discussion, and the easiest way to demonstrate this is to
look at where middle C sits on each clef. Below, you can see the note names
for the lines and spaces of each clef, and middle C is highlighted at the
beginning of each staff.

\hypertarget{tips-and-tricks}{%
\subsection{Tips and tricks}\label{tips-and-tricks}}

When asked about their methods, past students suggested working on clefs via:
- Memorization - The most widely used method uses flash cards or other
repetitive devices to practice identifying notes on each clef to ensure a
quick and efficient memorization. - Relative note identifications - Some
students remember one important note for each clef and then visually ``count''
through the alphabet upward or downward to find pitches in unfamiliar clefs.
For example, you could memorize where C sits in each clef and count steps
(letter names), or you could expand that concept to memorize how thirds are
stacked to move around more quickly. While this is a reasonable method for
familiarizing yourself with clefs, it will ultimately be too slow and
inconsistent to be practical. - The final suggestion was to determine the
visual relationship of your weaker clefs to your strongest clef, and then use
this to read in the new clef. - For example, if you are primarily comfortable
in treble-clef, you could remember that alto-clef moves all of the pitches
down by a step relative to treble clef. (This ignores octave displacement, of
course.) In this case, if you read alto clef as a treble clef but \emph{up} a
step, this compensates and gives you a quick visual method for reading the
clef. - To demonstrate this method: if a note head is on the line where B
would be in treble clef, you could ``translate'' that pitch into alto clef by
moving up a step (or letter name) to find that it is C. - You would then need
to find the visual relationships for each clef, because each will have a
different visual distance and direction compared to your primary clef. - Like
the relative note identification method above, this could be slow and
inconsistent, but if one regularly transposes, this could be used effectively.

Thus far, we have focused on the building blocks for constructing music such
as pitches, intervals, chords, and melodic interaction, but we have yet to
look at how these elements combine to create harmony. To study harmony, we
need a tool that describes chords and sonorities based on their function
rather than their components.

To this point, we have used leadsheet notation to convey the essential
components of a chord: root, bass note, quality, inversion, and any additional
pitches. But a single leadsheet chord does not provide context about its role
in the music.

Cmin7/E-flat

From this, we know that the chord has the pitches C, E-flat, G, and B-flat
with the E-flat as the lowest voice, but we do not know how it relates to the
chords around it. Is it stable, and does it sound final? Or is it unstable and
pulling toward a different chord?

When music theorists want to discuss diatonic (key-based) function, we label
chords using a Roman numeral system based on the chord's position within a
particular key.

\hypertarget{goals-for-this-topic-2}{%
\section{Goals for this topic}\label{goals-for-this-topic-2}}

Using the examples below, determine: - what are the diatonic qualities of all
triads in seventh chords in major and minor - If we consider these examples to
be ``diatonic,'' does every quality occur naturally or do some require
accidentals? - What is the relationship between chords in major and minor? -
how Roman numerals are created and labeled - What information does each part
(e.g.~Roman numeral, lower-case vs.~upper-case, inversion figures, etc.) of
the Roman numeral convey? - Are the inversion figures identical to the figured
bass discussed in the class reading from this unit? If not, how do they
differ? - How do leadsheet notation and Roman numerals differ in the
information that they convey?

\textbf{Note that the ABC notation used in these examples has limitations on
what kind of text can be entered. In the Roman numeral system, everything
other than the Roman numeral itself should be written as superscript.}

You may already be familiar with the basics of using Roman numerals for
labeling diatonic chords, but it is helpful to have a complete breakdown of
the system into its fundamental components.

  \emph{Root} - The number (e.g.~one, two, three, etc.) associated with a
  Roman numeral denotes the scale degree on which the chord is built.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If there is no accidental in front of the Roman numeral, the chord is
    built off the diatonic scale degree.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      The only exception to this rule is the viiø chord in minor; this chord
      is built off of \texttt{ti} (raised seventh scale degree), and this is
      considered the diatonic function. The naturally-occurring VII chord is
      used \emph{much} less and has a more limited scope in common practice.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    If there is an accidental in front of the Roman numeral, this affects only
    the root of the chord by raising or lowering it.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      The viiø chord in minor does not require an accidental because it is
      assumed because of its diatonic function.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Chordal third} - The case (i.e.~upper-case versus lower-case) of the
  Roman numeral denotes the quality of the chordal third.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    All upper-case Roman numerals have a major third. This includes major
    triads, augmented triads, major major chords, and major minor chords.
  \item
    All lower-case Roman numerals have a minor third. This includes all minor
    triads, diminished triads, minor minor chords, diminished minor chords,
    and diminished diminished chords.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Chordal fifth} - The chordal fifth is altered by adding either a o
  (the diminished symbol) for lowered fifths or a + for raised fifths.
\item
  \emph{Chordal sevenths} - To show a chordal seventh is present, you only
  need to use an inversion figure that implies a seventh chord (i.e.~7, 6/5,
  4/3, or 4/2).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A seventh chord inversion figure with no alteration implies a minor
    seventh above the root. It may be helpful to think of this as the
    ``default'' chordal seventh.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Having a minor interval as default is different than chordal thirds and
      fifths, because both of those chord members have ``defaults'' of a major
      interval.
    \item
      We do this for two reasons:

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        We cannot raise a M7 above the root; it just becomes the root.
      \item
        A d7 would be lowered \emph{twice} if we used a M7 as default, and we
        would have to devise a new system for showing this.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    A M is added before the inversion figure for all major seventh chords,
    even though they do occur diatonically. This allows us to differentiate
    chord qualities clearly once secondary functions and mode mixture are
    introduced later in the course. Non-diatonic harmonies are common enough
    that the Roman numeral system must be able to clearly distinguish them
    while retaining its clarity.
  \item
    The diminished symbol, o, is added before the inversion figure for fully
    diminished seventh chords. This also shows that the chordal fifth is
    lowered, the same as in a triad.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      If you think of a m7 above the root as the default chordal seventh for
      inversion figures, then adding o lowers the chordal seventh by a half
      step.
    \item
      As you know, half diminished seventh chords (diminished minor chords)
      have a lowered fifth above the root but a \emph{minor} seventh, rather
      than the diminished seventh of a fully diminished seventh chord. For
      half diminished chords, we replace the o with a ø to show that the
      chordal fifth is lowered but the chordal seventh is a m7 above the root.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Remember that when you add an inversion to a seventh chord, you do not need a
7 anymore. The inversion implies the seventh.

By having each part of a Roman numeral describe an isolated chord tone, we are
able to accurately describe any chord that can occur in our tonal harmony
system, regardless of whether it has a standard function.

*For clarity's sake, we \textbf{always} use a sharp or flat symbol to show
that we are raising or lowering the root, even if you are actually adding a
natural. When analyzing pieces that change keys--especially to distant
keys--this makes it much easier to look for similar patterns, regardless of
whether the key signature uses sharps or flats.

**Because the diminished symbol o implies the interval of a d5 AND a d7, you
must use the half-diminished symbol if you wish to alter the fifth but leave
the chordal seventh as a m7 above the root.

\hypertarget{add-and-sub}{%
\subsection{Add and sub}\label{add-and-sub}}

There are two more possible additions for Roman numerals, but these are
advanced techniques are will not be necessary until Unit 19. For completeness,
we will discuss them here, but if you would rather skip this for now, please
do so.

The word add is used when a tone is a functional part of the chord but does
not belong to a standard triad or seventh chord. A good example of this would
be a triad that has a functional 9th above the root. For example, in C major,
if a C major triad were to have a D as necessary to the function of that
chord, it would be labeled Iadd 9. This clearly identifies the triad plus the
additional ninth, but it also omits the chordal seventh. If it \emph{were} a
major seventh chord, you would not need use the add function, because a 9
would imply everything below it. So a IM9 is assumed to have 9th, 7th, 5th,
and 3rd above the root.

The word sub is used when a tone \emph{replaces} another chord tone. The
replaced chord tone is always the closest chord tone below the subbed chord
tone. For example, if the tonic triad in C major had a 4th above the root
instead of the chordal third, you would label that as Isub4. This implies that
the 4th replaces the chord tone directly below it, so this would be a triad
with C, F, and G.

The simplest definition of music is ``organized sound,'' and we can use this
definition as a launching point for discussing pitch collections and scales.
If we accept that music is ``organized sound,'' then the method used to
organize it will define the \emph{style} of composition. For this course, we
will study \emph{tonal} music, because \emph{tonal} describes the
organizational method--or style--of this music.

\hypertarget{tonal-music}{%
\section{Tonal music}\label{tonal-music}}

Tonal music is organized around a central tone called the \emph{tonic}.

And once we have a central pitch around which we build a tonality, every pitch
in the tonality is defined by its relationship to that pitch. It is these
intervallic relationships that differentiate one pitch collection from
another, and we can categorize each pitch collection by studying their
commonalities and differences.

In Unit 1, we defined moveable-do solfege as a way for us to look at the
relationships between a group of pitches that are organized around a central
pitch. In doing so, we created a \emph{scale}, even though we didn't define it
as such. Whenever you group any number of pitches, you create a
\emph{collection}. However, when you order a collection by the frequency of
each pitch--or more simply stated, how high or low the pitches are--you create
a scale. So a scale is \emph{a collection of pitches that are organized in an
ascending or descending form}, and consequently create a fixed intervallic
pattern. A scale can encompass any tuning system or style of composition.

Certain scales are at the core of all common practice harmony, and as a music
student, you are likely already familiar with these: \emph{major, minor,
modal, pentatonic, and chromatic}. Below, we discuss the diatonic scales
(i.e.~major and minor) and Topic 2b details the others. We will explore some
extended scales in Unit 22.

\hypertarget{diatonic-music}{%
\subsection{Diatonic music}\label{diatonic-music}}

For the majority of this course, we will be discussing \emph{diatonic} music,
which is a subset of tonal music. The term \emph{diatonic} can have a variety
of meanings depending on context, but for this course, we will be using this
term to refer to music that: - is built around a tonic pitch - includes all
seven pitch names (i.e.~letters) - creates harmonic tension and release using
tonic and dominant harmonies (more on this in Unit 6)

Put simply, our musical hierarchy is:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Music} - organized sound

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{Tonal music} - music organized around a central pitch

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      \emph{Diatonic music} - tonal music that uses all seven letter names
      only once and follows a specific order of intervals

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        \emph{Diatonic scale} - a ascending (or descending) ordering of all
        seven pitches in a diatonic pitch collection, contained within one
        octave

As you listen through all of the examples below, you should: - describe the
pattern that determines the pitches in the \emph{major} scale and all forms of
\emph{minor} scales regardless of starting pitch - You can think of this
question as how to describe the scale without using note names or solfege. -
figure out why \emph{natural, melodic,} and \emph{harmonic} minors are named
as they are - memorize the names for each scale degree (i.e.~tonic) as well as
the corresponding numeral notation - how the names for each scale degree are
derived (e.g.~How are dominant and subdominant scale degrees related?) -
incorporate the Latin spelling for every solfege

\hypertarget{important-notes}{%
\subsection{Important notes}\label{important-notes}}

The following examples demonstrate how the tune of \emph{Happy Birthday} would
be written if only using the notes from a particular scale. In most examples,
scale degrees are numbered below each pitch as well as solfege using movable
``do.'' Additionally, scale degrees are named above the pitches for the
examples in major and melodic minor. When determining your pitch collections,
pay particular attention to the differences of the sixth and seventh scale
degrees.

\hypertarget{intervallic-patterns}{%
\subsection{Intervallic patterns}\label{intervallic-patterns}}

In diatonic music, each scale has seven pitches. All seven letters can be used
once, and no letter can be used more than once. This creates a series of 2nds
that create our scale.

Major scales have an intervallic pattern of:

\emph{(W = whole-step, H = half-step, A = augmented 2nd)}

W - W - H - W - W - W - H

Natural minor scales have an intervallic pattern of:

W - H - W - W - H - W - W

Harmonic minor scales have an intervallic pattern of:

W - H - W - W - H - A - H

Melodic minor scales have both an ascending and descending form. The
intervallic pattern for descending melodic minor is identical to a descending
natural minor scale. (The necessity of this seemingly redundant pattern is
discussed below under ``Why we \emph{need} three minor scales.'') The
intervallic pattern for 4ascending melodic minor is:

W - H - W - W - W - W - H

\hypertarget{labeling-scale-degrees}{%
\subsection{Labeling scale degrees}\label{labeling-scale-degrees}}

When discussing scales, it is helpful to have a method that refers to pitches
without referencing a specific key. For example, the first ``Happy Birthday''
example on the previous page is written in G major, but there are eleven other
tonics around which we could structure that melody's intervallic structure. In
order to reference the interval pattern rather than the actual pitches, we use
\emph{scale degrees}.

One common way to communicate pitches of the scale is to use scale degree
numbers. We denote these by placing a caret \texttt{\^{}} above the scale
degree number. For example, the pitch that is a fifth above the tonic would be
called fifth scale degree and would be written as \texttt{\^{}5}, although the
caret would be above the numeral, not to the side.

A second common way to describe scale degrees is to use \emph{solfege
syllables}. In this system, each scale degree is assigned a single-syllable
Latin word, and this can be helpful when sight-singing. The chart below shows
all seven base solfege syllables and how each can be altered for raised and
lowered pitches. If a solfege symbol is marked as ``N/A,'' this alteration is
non-functional in tonal harmony.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
Scale degree & Solfege syllable & Raised & Lowered \\
\midrule
\endhead
\^{}1 & do & di & N/A \\
\^{}2 & re & ri & ra \\
\^{}3 & mi & N/A & me \\
\^{}4 & fa & fi & N/A \\
\^{}5 & sol & si & se \\
\^{}6 & la & li & le \\
\^{}7 & ti & N/A & te \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

A final method for labeling scale degrees is to use the names of the functions
of each pitch as it relates to tonic. These names evolved over centuries of
theory treatises from scholars such as Rameau, Riemann, Secther, Schoenberg,
and Schenker. We will not use these names often in this course, but knowing
them can help understand harmonic function when that concept is introduced.

They are: 1. Tonic 2. Supertonic 3. Mediant 4. Subdominant 5. Dominant 6.
Submediant 7. Leading-tone/Subtonic

Notice the relationship between any term and its counterpart as denoted by the
prefix \texttt{sub}. The dominant is a fifth above the tonic; the subdominant
is a fifth below the tonic. The mediant is a third above the tonic; the
submediant is a third below the tonic.

The supertonic is a 2nd above the tonic, but because of the importance and
function of the leading-tone, its scale degree name changes to reflect the
difference between a major 2nd below the tonic versus the minor 2nd below the
tonic. If the 2nd below the tonic is a whole-step, we call it the subtonic. If
the 2nd below the tonic is a half-step, we call it the leading tone. This is
true in both major and minor.

\hypertarget{tonal-centers-and-modes}{%
\subsection{Tonal centers and modes}\label{tonal-centers-and-modes}}

We consider a key to be defined by its tonic, so if two scales share a tonic,
they are considered to be the same key but different \emph{modes} of each
other. For example, G major and G minor are the same key, but different modes.
This is confusing for many students, because they have always associated their
concept of a key with its key signature.

\hypertarget{why-we-need-three-minor-scales}{%
\subsection{Why we need three minor
scales}\label{why-we-need-three-minor-scales}}

Most intermediate music students learn various forms of the minor scale, but
they do not often give much thought as to why.

Natural minor is the most obvious. It uses all of the naturally occurring
notes from the key signature.

We will discuss the role of harmonic minor more when we begin analyzing
chords, but as the name implies, it is a form of minor that emphasizes the
most common scale degrees from a harmonic standpoint.

The ``Happy Birthday'' examples above are perfect for exploring the importance
of melodic minor. By keeping the interval sizes from ``Happy Birthday'' but
changing the pitches to fit the various forms of minor, you can hear three
similar but distinct versions of ``Happy Birthday.'' When a student first
listens to the natural minor version, they often feel that the first
\texttt{te} does not work with the rest of the tune, and in the harmonic minor
version, the augmented 2nd that occurs between \texttt{ti} and \texttt{le} is
jarring. On the other hand, the melodic minor version sounds entirely correct
(although some may not like the darker tone of a traditionally ``happy''
song.)

This easily highlights the role of melodic minor -- to create melodies in
minor. By having both an ascending and descending version, we can resolve the
sixth and seventh scale degrees upward and downward by relying on the tendency
of those scale degrees. \texttt{Te} and \texttt{le} both have a strong
downward pull and almost always resolve downward. \texttt{Ti} and \texttt{la}
both have a strong upward pull and tend to resolve upward. These are general
rules and are occasionally broken, but I encourage you to play with the
example below to hear how ``strange'' the piece becomes if you do not allow
the sixth and seventh scale degrees to account for their resolutions. (Try
putting \texttt{la} in for every sixth scale degree for the most obviously
jarring version.)

This text assumes that you are already familiar with the basics of rhythmic
notation, so we will be skipping most of the basic rhythmic terminology. If
you would like to learn about these terms (or review), I have included some
materials from \emph{Open Music Theory} in the
\href{04-intro-rhythm/a2-simplemeter.html}{Further Reading}.

\hypertarget{rhythmic-review}{%
\section{Rhythmic review}\label{rhythmic-review}}

Rhythm is the temporal aspect of music; it is how we organize the sounds and
silences of music within time. At its most basic, rhythmic notation tells us
when a sound or silence starts and ends, but musical rhythmic notation tries,
and mostly succeeds, to show higher levels of organization to make
understanding the groupings within the music more understandable to the
musician.

First, a few basic terms: \emph{Meter} is the manner in which we organize
strong and weak pulses in music over time, and it is from this grouping that
we determine the length of each \emph{measure}. Western music typically uses a
\emph{time signature}--represented at the beginning of the music as two
stacked arabic numbers--as a shorthand to quickly convey the meter to a
trained musician. At its most basic, time signatures tell us two things: - how
we divide the meter into regular or irregular pulses called \emph{beats} - how
many of these \emph{beats} are in the measure

If we imagine meter as a hierarchy, the \emph{measure} is the top level and
\emph{beats} are how we divide the measure. Beats are then divided into
\emph{divisions}, and \emph{divisions} can be further divided into
\emph{subdivisions}.

Finally, please note that meter is somewhat subjective and can be greatly
altered by many factors, especially tempo. Where one listener might listen to
a piece with four quarter-notes per measure and feel that the quarter notes
are the beat, another listener may listen to the same piece and hear the beat
in a slow two with the half-note as the beat.

\hypertarget{simple-meters}{%
\section{Simple meters}\label{simple-meters}}

A \emph{regular} meter is one in which every \emph{beat} is the same length.
There are two types of regular meters, and the following example looks at the
first of type of regular meter: the \emph{simple} meter.

rhythmic notation of beaming in simple meters - a list of common meters in

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-19}}

This is always an interesting class discussion, because creating objective
definitions depends on the students differentiating their opinions from the
underlying principles of the concept.

While most students intuitively understand the concept of a simple meter, it
is often difficult to agree on the common characteristic of all simple meters.
When asked to identify what all simple meters have in common, students often
focus on the visual or mathematical representation of the time signature--for
example, ``The top number of the time signature is divisible by two.'' Not
only is this not true for all simple meters (e.g.~3/4 or 5/4) as shown in
Examples 4a, it still would not differentiate this class of meters from
compound meters. 6/8 and 12/8 are both compound time signatures that have a
top number that is divisible by two.

The common characteristic of all simple meters is how the beat is divided.
\emph{Simple meters are any regular meter in which the beat is divided into
two equal parts.}

\hypertarget{duple-triple-and-quadruple}{%
\subsection{Duple, Triple, and Quadruple}\label{duple-triple-and-quadruple}}

When looking at the above examples, simple meters can be divided into
collections of duple, triple, and quadruple meters: - simple duple meter: 2 -
ex: 2/4, 2/2, 2/8, 2/16 - simple triple meter: 3 - ex: 3/4, 3/2, 3/8, 3/16 -
simple quadruple meter: 4 - ex: 4/4, 4/2, 4/8, 4/16

While this is correct for the meters above, it does not provide a definition
of what these numbers mean. \emph{These words--simple, triple, quadruple, and
so on--are used to signify how many beats are in a measure.}

\hypertarget{simple-time-signatures}{%
\subsection{Simple time signatures}\label{simple-time-signatures}}

Most students correctly identify the function of the top and bottom numbers of
the simple time signatures (but struggle with the same concept for compound
meters).

For simple meter time signatures: - the top number represents the number of
beats in the measure - the bottom number denotes the rhythmic value of the
beat - if a 4 is on the bottom, the beat is represented by a quarter note - if
an 8 is on the bottom, the beat is represented by an eighth note

To easily figure out the bottom number's rhythmic value, I tell students to
imagine that the bottom note becomes the denominator (lower number) of a
fraction under a numerator of 1. A bottom number of 4 becomes 1/4--a quarter.
A bottom number of 2 becomes 1/2--a half.

\hypertarget{beat-counting-system-in-simple-meters}{%
\subsection{Beat-counting system in simple
meters}\label{beat-counting-system-in-simple-meters}}

It seems that for every unique syllable, there is a beat-counting system for
affixing syllables to beats, divisions, and subdivisions. Each of these have
their strengths and weaknesses, but for this theory course, we will be using
the following for simple meters: - \texttt{beat\ numbers} for each beat
(e.g.~1, 2, 3, etc.) - \texttt{\&} for the division (e.g.~1-\& 2-\& etc.) -
\texttt{e} (pronounced `ee') and a (pronounced `ah') for the first level
subdivisions (e.g.~1-e-\&-a 2-e-\&-a)

While this system can blend together aurally if said quickly, its primary
benefit is that it has a unique syllable for each level through the first
subdivision, and this makes communicating easier with higher specificity. For
example, it is specific to ask, ``Is the G4 on the `e' of beat four a
non-chord tone?'' and this does not require further information.

\hypertarget{theoretically-ideal-rhythmic-notation-versus-common-practice}{%
\subsection{Theoretically ideal rhythmic notation versus common
practice}\label{theoretically-ideal-rhythmic-notation-versus-common-practice}}

The two examples above demonstrate something I term ``theoretically ideal''
rhythmic notation versus two counterparts of the same rhythm beamed in a more
commonly used manner. For these: - \emph{Theoretically ideal} rhythmic
notation never hides a beat under a note length longer than the beat, and
instead uses tied notes to represent longer note values. - There are many
common exceptions, most notably half notes and whole notes in relatively short
measures, but this depends on the meter and context. - Theoretically ideal
\emph{beaming} applies to any note length that can be connected by
beams--eighth notes, sixteenth notes, and further subdivisions.

This is very much inline with with this text's general intention.
Well-engraved music is meant to look pleasing, but it also should be easy for
a performer to read. This often leads to grouping rhythmic patterns according
to non-rhythmic ideas: lyrics, spacing measures across the page, phrasing, a
limited number of systems, etc. \emph{Theoretically ideal} rhythmic notation
would never obscure a beat in order to provide the easiest reading of harmony
within a score. Of course, no musician will ever use this in its strictest
form because it would become difficult to read in many situations; imagine not
using a whole note in 4/4 time and instead using four tied quarter notes.

That being said, it is important for students of music to begin trying to
understand how grouping and beaming decisions are made, because in harmonic
analysis, it is easy to sometimes miss voices because of obscured beats. It is
also an excellent thought exercise to help students begin demonstrating
mastery of meters and rhythmic values.

In music, a sequence occurs when a musical pattern is established then
repeated at various transpositions. Sequences can be any combination of the
following categories: - melodic, harmonic, or both - ascending or descending -
diatonic or chromatic - single or multiple parts within each repeated segment

Sequences work because they rely on one of the most fundamental human
characteristics: our ability to identify patterns. All music relies on a
listener's familiarity with the tendencies within a style, but these
tendencies can be broken if a composer is able to create a new pattern to
guide the listener. Once a musical pattern is established, it will sound
``right'' to a listener, even if this pattern defies standard tonal
conventions.

\hypertarget{terminology-of-a-sequence}{%
\section{Terminology of a sequence}\label{terminology-of-a-sequence}}

For our discussions, we must differentiate between the overall pattern of the
sequence and the individual segments within the sequence. We will use the term
\emph{sequence} to refer the whole, but we will use the word \emph{iteration}
to discuss an individual segment within the sequence. You can think of the
iteration as one complete ``building block'' that is transposed repeatedly to
create the sequence.

\hypertarget{melodic-sequences}{%
\section{Melodic sequences}\label{melodic-sequences}}

We will begin studying sequences by looking at melodic sequences because they
demonstrate the basic principles without the complications of multiple voices.
Look at the following melodic patterns; each one contains a few iterations at
the beginning of a melodic sequence. Complete the pattern through the
designated ending pitch and then discuss the repetition using the following
terms: - ascending or descending - diatonic or chromatic - intervals of
transposition - length of pattern - single or multiple parts within each
repetition

Of note, when describing melodic sequences to another person, you can assume
that the reader is looking at the music and therefore can see the entire first
iteration. This means that you should not have to describe pattern of the
iteration. Instead, we focus our description on \emph{how the pattern is
transposed}, not on describing the intervals within the \emph{initial}
segment.

\hypertarget{conclusions-20}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-20}}

The terminology for describing sequences should be familiar because each term
is used in a similar manner across all aspects of music, however, each term
has some specific connotations when applied to sequences. - Ascending or
descending describe the direction of the transpositions, not necessarily each
interval within the pattern. - The interval(s) of transposition are most
easily found by looking at the relationship between the first pitch of each
iteration. Remember that as long as you know the starting pitch, you can
extract all of the intervals within an iteration by using the intervals from
the \emph{first} iteration. - The length of the sequence should be obvious
simply by looking at the music, however, so it is more helpful to focus on the
length of the iterations. You should use the smallest common identifier for
one iteration.For example, if the first iteration lasts an entire measure or
more, you will describe it using a number of measures (e.g.~one measures, two
measures, etc.), but if a single iteration does not last a full measure, you
will describe it by the number of beats it lasts. - Some iterations may have
multiple parts, so you will need to look closely at the entire pattern to make
sure that you do not have more than one transposition. For example, if your
pattern is transposed down by a third then up by second, you will need to
describe both parts in your description.

The discussion of chromatic and diatonic sequences, however, requires
clarification. - A true \textbf{diatonic pattern} only uses notes within the
key signature so they do not require a quality when discussing the
transposition. For example, it is incorrect to describe a diatonic pattern
using, ``The pattern repeats in ascending \emph{major} 3rds,'' because
diatonic patterns will have a mix of major 3rds and minor 3rds depending on
which scale degree the iteration starts. Instead, we would say, ``The pattern
is transposed in diatonic ascending 3rds,'' because this tells the reader to
go up a 3rd and use whatever note is in the key signature. - Conversely,
\textbf{chromatic patterns} \emph{do} require a quality on the transposition
for the interval, because the pattern repeats \emph{exactly} using the same
intervals from the initial iteration. If we isolate the third sequence from
the melodic examples (see example below), we have a fixed intervallic pattern
-- in this case, descending m2, ascending m2, descending P4 -- that is then
repeated by transposing that \emph{exact intervallic pattern} down a m2. In
short, a chromatic pattern is assumed to transpose every part of the pattern
exactly at a fixed interval(s) unless otherwise noted.

The fifth example above is the most difficult to complete and classify,
because it mixes elements from both diatonic and chromatic sequences. It has a
diatonic transposition, but each iteration can only be defined by a fixed
intervallic structure. So we would describe this as a diatonic sequence that
descends in 3rds, while each iteration is four pitches with the intervals of
descending m2, ascending m2, and descending P4. Notice that the interval of
transposition is found by comparing the first pitches of each iteration,
\emph{not} the interval between the last pitch of an iteration to the first
pitch of the next iteration.

\hypertarget{harmonic-sequences}{%
\section{Harmonic sequences}\label{harmonic-sequences}}

Sequences occur harmonically as well, and when they do, they can supplant
standard function or inversion conventions. As mentioned in the introduction,
sequences work because they establish a pattern for the listener and then
fulfill this new goal. Look at the following example of a two voice pattern.
The first bar establishes tonic, and then a sequence begins in the second
measure. After listening to it, discuss with your classmates whether it
\emph{sounds} functional. If you were going to describe this to another
person, how would you describe it? Once you finish your discussion, propose a
harmonic progression that fits the melody.

While there are some variations on how you could harmonize this sequence, it
is possible to make a chord progression that has diatonic chords with roots
separated by a P5. I have suggested a version of this below. Using my
progression, try adding a third voice as an alto line. As you do this,
remember that the sequential pattern will not start until the second measure,
so the first measure can just fill out missing chord tones. Your line does not
have to have all stepwise motion like the outer two voices do, but it should
follow some sort of repeating pattern.

\hypertarget{conclusions-21}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-21}}

In your classification of the two-voice progression above, you likely
described each line individually (e.g.~descending diatonic 2nds that last one
whole note), or you may have described the intervals between the two lines for
each measure (e.g.~a diatonic 7th resolving to diatonic 6th, then repeating
after transposing down a diatonic 2nd). Neither of these is sufficient,
however, once we add a third voice.

Instead, we classify \emph{harmonic} sequences by describing the movement of
the \emph{roots} of each chord. We do \emph{not} label harmonic sequences by
inversions or the bass line. If we were to identify sequences by bass lines,
all sequences that created a particular style of bass line (e.g.~descending by
stepwise motion) would be grouped together, even if they shared no harmonic
similarities. (You can see this concept in the next two examples below.)
Taking this into account, the description of the sequence in the example above
would be: - A diatonic harmonic sequence with root-movement by descending 5th
that alternates between root-position seventh chords and second-inversion
triads.

\hypertarget{complex-harmonic-sequences}{%
\section{Complex harmonic sequences}\label{complex-harmonic-sequences}}

The above sequence has only one interval and direction in its root movement
pattern, a descending P5. Similar to the final example of the melodic
sequences above, though, it is also possible for harmonic sequences to have
two or more parts within each repetition. Look at the example below, and
classify it using our terms from above: - ascending or descending - diatonic
or chromatic - intervals of transposition - length of pattern - single or
multiple parts within each repetition

\{\% include abc-example.html number=``5'' abc=ex5 \%\}

Hopefully you were able to identify that the sequence only covers the first
three measures, the final measure is simply a way to allow the pattern to
repeat smoothly. For the sequence, there are two possibilities to describe it.
You could consider each measure a pattern in which case you would say that
this is a diatonic sequence that descends by 3rd. If you consider the pattern
to be a half note, though, it has multiple parts. It is a diatonic sequence of
triads that moves down by 4th and then up by 2nd. Either is correct, but the
second version communicates a clearer picture of the pattern.

How does your description of the sequence change if we change some of the
voices to alter the chords' inversions as in the example below?

While any sequence that establishes a pattern and has clear voice-leading can
function, there are common sequences that many composers have relied upon. We

\href{07-harmonic-functions/a1-diaprogcirclefifths.html}{Unit 7a} when
exploring how voice-leading led to the standard circle-of-fifths progression.

Sequences can also be used to explain how non-diatonic progressions function
in a diatonic context. One common sequence occurs when first-inversion chords
are used in succession to create a stepwise bass line. A \emph{parallel 6
sequence} is any sequence with repeated first-inversion triads, most commonly
moving downward by step. Notice that this does not create objectional parallel
voices as long as the root of the chord stays above the chordal fifth. If
these two voices are inverted, the result will contain parallel perfect
fifths. To label a sequence of parallel six chords, label each chord with its
Roman numeral and inversion figure and then place a bracket under the entire
sequence with a label of ``parallel six sequence.''

This sequence takes its name from the German Baroque composer, Johann
Pachelbel, who composed a canon using this sequence as its foundation. Since
then, the harmonic progression has become a common structure on which to build
multiple styles of music. The comedian Rob Paravonian satired many of these
takes in his now famous ``Pachelbel Rant.'' \textbf{(Caution: contains strong
language)}

Further to our discussion of the importance of patterns in music, please view
the following TED Talk by Dr.~Scott Rickard. He used mathematics to try to
create music without any repetition, and the results are\ldots interesting.

In discussing key signatures, we found that, if we repeatedly ascend via the
the interval of the P5, we eventually cycle through all twelve pitch classes
before repeating. And if we alter a particular one of those perfect 5ths by a
half step--creating a diminished 5th after moving through the first seven
letter names--the cycle repeats back on itself and creates the diatonic
collection of seven pitches that we associate with Western diatonic tonality.

We can also apply this effect to pitches by stacking them on top of each other
to create basic harmonies. Listen to the next example which stacks diatonic
5ths--meaning 5ths that reflect the key signature used for this tonal
center--to create a series of perfect 5ths. As you listen, you will probably
hear each of these dyads as having an ``open'' or ``undefined'' sound. Feel
free to experiment using the text entry box below the example to see if you
can insert a note into those open 5ths that creates a pleasing sound.

As you probably noticed, you can create a variety of interesting harmonies,
but the ones that felt the most familiar occurred when placed a pitch in each
5th that divided them equally. And in doing so, you created the basic harmonic
structure for all diatonic music: \emph{the triad}.

\hypertarget{building-diatonic-triads}{%
\section{Building diatonic triads}\label{building-diatonic-triads}}

All diatonic triads have exactly three pitches, although chordal members may
be doubled and certain chord members can occasionally be omitted (and
therefore implied) depending on the context. We name the chord members by the
distance above the bottom pitch \textbf{when the chord is stacked in thirds}:
- the lowest pitch is called the \emph{root} of the chord - the pitch that is
a 3rd above the root is called the \emph{chordal third} - the pitch that is a
5th above the root is called the \emph{chordal fifth}

This can be confusing to beginning theory students, because we refer to
intervals, scale degrees, and chordal members using the same ordinal
numbers--thirds, fifths, etc.--and most often do not use the word ``chordal.''
As you become more experienced in describing these things, you will be able to
discern the meaning from context, but if you would like to avoid confusion for
now, you can preface the ordinal number with the word ``chordal'' until you
are comfortable.

\hypertarget{a-note-on-terminology}{%
\subsection{A note on terminology}\label{a-note-on-terminology}}

As dyads have two pitches, the word ``triad'' implies \emph{any} collection of
three pitches. In diatonic music, however, we use this word to refer to a
certain intervallic structure, so until we reach the unit on post-tonal
harmony, you may assume that the word ``triad'' refers to the stacked thirds
of diatonic harmony.

\hypertarget{triad-qualities}{%
\section{Triad qualities}\label{triad-qualities}}

If the study of the evolution of music, you will find that early harmony
focused on perfect intervals similar to this example, but diatonic harmony as
we know did not truly begin until music began regularly featuring a third
chordal member. By stacking two intervals of a third, we create a
\emph{triad}, which contains not only the two thirds, but also the interval of
a fifth between the outer pitches. Any harmonic system which relies on
stacking thirds is called \emph{tertian harmony}.

Triads are important to almost all of Western music and form the basic unit in
diatonic (key-based) harmony. While our ultimate goal is to describe how
triads \emph{function} harmonically, it is important that we are able to
identify the structure of triads themselves independent of their diatonic
functions, so we will begin by studying their intervallic structure.

Using the next example: - determine what role each chord member -- root,
third, and fifth -- plays in determining the quality of a triad - find all
three intervals contained in a \emph{root-position} triad for each chord
quality

\hypertarget{conclusions-22}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-22}}

Your first goal should be to come up with a way to define each triad's
\emph{quality}. To begin, you may classify triadic qualities by dividing them
into two groups based on the defining chord members of the triads.

When looking at a diatonic triad in root position: - If the chordal fifth is
either a diminished or augmented fifth, then the triad is labeled as
\emph{diminished} or \emph{augmented} respectively. - Diminished triads always
have a minor 3rd between the root and chordal third. - Augmented triads always
have a major 3rd between the root and chordal third. - If the chordal fifth is
a perfect fifth, the chordal third determines whether a triad is \emph{major}
or \emph{minor}. - Major triads have a M3 above the root. - Minor triads have
a m3 above the root.

From this, we can create a couple of simple groupings based on the chord
members: - Between root and chordal 3rd - Augmented and major triads always
have a M3 (or inversion) - Minor and diminished triads always have a m3 (or
inversion) - Between root and chordal fifth - Major and minor triads always
have P5 (or inversion) - Diminished triads always have a d5 (or inversion) -
Augmented triads always have an A5 (or inversion)

Therefore, if a triad is in root position, you can determine triad qualities
by the measuring the intervals of the stacked thirds.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Major: M3 + m3
\item
  Minor: m3 + M3
\item
  Diminished: m3 + m3
\item
  Augmented: M3 + M3
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{triad-inversions-and-their-labels}{%
\section{Triad inversions and their
labels}\label{triad-inversions-and-their-labels}}

Because triads have three pitches, there are three possible configurations
that depend on which note of the triad is in the lowest voice. We will call
these \emph{inversions}, but they are sometimes referred to as
\emph{positions}. The system that we use to label inversions relies on the
intervals within the triad.

Using the next example, you should: - determine the naming conventions of
inversions - know the shorthand method for labeling inversions - develop a
method for determining the chord quality of a triad that is not presented in
root position (stacked as two thirds on top of each other.) - find the rest of
the interval \emph{sizes} between chord members of a triad (Hint: This may
involve moving some chord members up or down an octave) - thirds (2) - fourth
(1) - fifth (1) - sixths (2) - relate these interval sizes to our system for
labeling triad inversions - provide inversion figures for root position,
first-inversion, and second-inversion triads

NOTE: Because ABC notation is not capable of using superscript, the inversion
figures in the next example are notated as fractions. If you were to write
these by hand or use music notation software, you would notate all inversion
figures in superscript as stacked numbers without a dividing line. For
example, a major chord in first inversion would be written as M6

\hypertarget{conclusions-23}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-23}}

From the simple presentation of the above example, you should have realized
that you cannot identify the inversion of the chord until you know the root.
The simplest method for finding the root for any triad is to re-arrange the
pitches until you have a triad that is stacked using only thirds. To be clear,
this means no fourths, no sixths, and everything within a octave. You can even
eliminate any duplicate pitches. Once you have this simplified arrangement of
pitches, you can easily determine the root and quality of the chord using the
method above.

For inversions, it is not necessary to know each interval within a triad, but
instead, you only need to identify the chordal member in the bass.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Root position: 5/3

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    the root of the chord is in the bass
  \item
    The \texttt{5} and \texttt{3} refer to the simple intervals above the bass
  \end{itemize}
\item
  First inversion: 6/3 (shortened to 6)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    the 3rd of the chord is in the bass
  \item
    The \texttt{6} and \texttt{3} refer to the simple intervals above the bass
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Second inversion: 6/4

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    the 5th of the chord is in the bass- The \texttt{6} and \texttt{4} refer
    to the simple intervals above the bass
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Of note, there are six different possible intervals in a triad, depending on
the inversion: two thirds, two sixths, one fourth, and one fifth. These
intervals always exist between the same two chord members. - The thirds exist
between the root/third and third/fifth. - The sixths appear when you invert
either of the thirds, so between the third/root and fifth/third. - The fifth
always exists between root/fifth. - The fourth is the inversion of the fifth,
so between fifth/root.

\hypertarget{triad-voicings}{%
\subsection{Triad voicings}\label{triad-voicings}}

Now that you understand the basic of triads and their inversions, we have to
account for the variety of ways that they appear in music. When analyzing
music, you must account for doubled pitches, implied harmonies, and a variety
of spacings across the range of the performers; all of which can make it
difficult to find the basic structure of the triad when looking at a musical
score.

We will start by dealing with the issue of spacing, and to do so we must
understand how the \emph{inversion} interacts with the chord's \emph{voicing}.

Look at the following example, and compare the closed and open voicings listed
there. You should: - be able to succinctly describe the differences - create a
process to convert any inverted and/or open-voiced triad into a root-position
triad in closed voicing

\hypertarget{conclusions-24}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-24}}

As students develop the process for finding any inversion, they usually work
through the following ideas: - Attempt \#1: Open voicing is spread out. -
True, but this is a subjective measure. What constitutes ``spread out?'' -
Attempt \#2: Closed voicings use only simple intervals and open positions have
compound intervals. - This is interesting in that it works if the chord only
has no repeated pitches, but does not hold up if a chord has repeated notes or
more than four distinct pitches. - Attempt \#3: - Closed voicings contain all
chord members within one octave. - This is almost there , but does not explain
how a chord with more than four pitches can be in closed position. - Attempt
\#4: Open voicing skips one of the voices. - This definition is almost there,
but the term ``voices'' is problematic because ``voices'' does not relate
directly to a chord.

A complete definition combines these ideas. - Closed voicing stacks all
pitches of a chord in an ascending order and does not skip a chordal member. -
Open voicings can have chord members stacked in any order and skip chord
members. - All open voicings will cover more than one octave because of this.

\hypertarget{root-versus-bass}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Root} versus
\emph{bass}}{Root versus bass}}\label{root-versus-bass}}

Understanding the difference between the terms \emph{root} and \emph{bass} is
the last piece of information necessary to find the quality of any chord;
students often confuse the two. The term \emph{bass} \textbf{always} refers to
the lowest voice of any chord. The \emph{root} is the lowest member of the
chord \textbf{if the chord is in root position}, meaning that the triad is
stacked as two thirds. If a chord is in root position, the \emph{root} and
\emph{bass} will be the same pitch, however if a triad is in first or second
inversion, the \emph{root} and \emph{bass} will be different pitches.

\hypertarget{finding-a-chord-quality-while-inverted}{%
\subsection{Finding a chord quality while
inverted}\label{finding-a-chord-quality-while-inverted}}

Combining a knowledge of inversions and voicings is critical in correctly
identifying chord qualities. Teachers often suggest to students that they can
find chord qualities by putting a chord in root position, but a chord in root
position can be spread across multiple staves and still difficult to parse. We
really mean that they should put the chord in root position \emph{and} closed
voicing. This allows the student to look at the interval qualities and
determine the quality of the triad based on their knowledge of triadic
interval structures.

I also suggest that you look at the method for identifying triads from the
\emph{Open Music Theory}. You can find this listed under the
\href{03-triads-7chords-leadsheet//a2-triads.html}{Further Reading} for this
topic.

Before we move on to fully analyzing harmonic function, we must define the
stylistic rules of the music we will be studying. If you remember from our
discussion of laws, rules, and strategies, rules are necessary to create a
style. They are the binding agents that create a genre, but they also provide
enough flexibility for composers within a style to carve out a unique voice.

For our beginning exploration of tonal harmony, we will be studying basic
diatonic harmony in a chorale style. We will use this not because it is
``superior'' to any other style, but because it is relatively straightforward
in its approach when compared to styles of music that came later. There are
countless styles of tonal music that have evolved over the last four
centuries, but a chorale style gives us the best starting place to study this
evolution. So as we progress through rules that might seem outdated, do not
lose sight of the \emph{process} that we are creating. If you understand why
each decision is made in this style, you will be able to intuit the next leap
forward. And as we add complexity, you will eventually be able to apply these
principles to \emph{any} style of tonal music, even those that do not employ
the underpinnings of tonic-dominant relationships.

\textbf{In the following example, each staff system highlights a different

\emph{spacing}. - Because \emph{range} is a simple maximum and minimum, I have
listed conservative estimates for each voice part. - These can vary widely
depending on the skill level of the intended performers but will be sufficient
for our early exercises in part-writing.

\hypertarget{conclusions-25}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-25}}

To this point, everything that we have discussed has been based on a two-voice
model, but to move into full diatonic harmony, we need to add inner voices and
fully flesh out the harmonies. When doing this, there are certain rules that
create better voice-leading and voicings when followed, but as with all
stylistic guidelines, please note that these rules are generally strong
suggestions rather than hard and fast rules. Good composers bend or break
these rules if it better serves their ideas.

\hypertarget{doubling}{%
\subsubsection{Doubling}\label{doubling}}

When voicing triads in four-part harmony, at least one note must be doubled.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Doubling the root is usually the ideal choice.
\item
  Doubling the fifth is the second best option.
\item
  Doubling the third is generally \emph{unacceptable}, although there are
  certain corner cases in which this can be necessary. As a rule of thumb, do
  not double the third unless you are working on a chord in which you've
  already been told that doubling the third is the best option.
\item
  If you need to omit a voice, the fifth is the only option, because the root
  and third are required to define the chord. Diminished triads are the only
  diatonic harmony which functionally benefit from a fifth, but even in these
  situations, the fifth might be the best omission if necessary.
\item
  You can triple the root if necessary, but this voicing lacks the depth of a
  chord with a fifth and can create a difficult voicing to continue writing
  afterwards. This is most commonly used as an ending chord of the piece
  (often after a V7).
\end{enumerate}

Doubling in a seventh chord is similar, but because you have four notes for
four voices, there is less freedom. 1. There must always be a root, third, and
seventh in the chord, because without any of them, the chord is no longer a
functional seventh chord. 2. If necessary, you can omit the fifth. 3. If the
fifth is ommitted, the root is the only chord tone that can be doubled. Do not
double the third or the seventh.

\hypertarget{spacing}{%
\subsubsection{Spacing}\label{spacing}}

Spacing is relatively straightfoward, but it can be difficult to create
consistent rules based on the examples. Your final conclusions should be: -
The bass \emph{can} be as far from the tenor as needed. - Between the soprano,
alto, and tenor voices, adjacent voices cannot be more than an octave apart.
Meaning that the: - Tenor and alto \emph{cannot} have more than an octave
between them. - Soprano and alto \emph{cannot} have more than an octave
between them. - Tenor and soprano \emph{can} have more than an octave between
them. - When the tenor and soprano are within an octave of each other, we call
this a \emph{closed voicing}. - When the tenor and soprano are more than an
octave apart, we call this an \emph{open voicing}.

In general, a good voicing will mimic the overtone series on which our harmony
is created. This details of this concept are discussed in Unit 11, but a
general rule of good voicing is to use wider intervals between lower voices
and narrower intervals between high voices.

\hypertarget{range}{%
\subsubsection{Range}\label{range}}

The ranges for each voice in the examples are conservative, but will serve us
well in our beginning part-writing. These are highly dependent on the intended
performers.

\hypertarget{voice-crossing}{%
\subsubsection{Voice-crossing}\label{voice-crossing}}

There was no easy way to notate this in the examples, but you should avoid
crossing your voices unless absolutely necessary. It is almost never
absolutely necessary and often creates voice-leading and range issues. As you
grow in your part-writing, you may find an occasional reason to cross voices,
but do not unnecessarily complicate your first attempts.

Egon explained this best in one of the greatest 80's movies, so bonus points
for anyone that understands this reference.

  Cadences are like the many different endings to a scentence or speech

\item
  It's not about if we can lable chords, but can we lable function.
\item
  Tonic is stable, Dominant is less stable as it feels like it eventually
  needs to resolve to \textbf{I}. Pre-dominants want to resolve to \textbf{V}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Cadence Types} - PAC: \textbf{V} to \textbf{I} with both chords in
root position. Soprano has to have \emph{do} on \textbf{I} chord. (Dominant
function chords to I) - IAC: Just break one of the rules from PAC. ex:
\textbf{vii} to \textbf{I}. Or \emph{mi} in the soprano line on \textbf{I}
chord. (Still must be a dominant function chord to I) - HC: Lands on the
\textbf{V} chord and doesn't resolve any farther (in root position). Before
the \textbf{V} any chord can preceed it. \textbf{V7} can still count as a half
cadence. It is just very uncommon as the \textbf{V7} has a strong pull to
\textbf{I}. Can never be \textbf{viiº} as there are tendency tones that need
to resolve. - PC: \textbf{IV} to \textbf{I}. Both are in root position. There
are no other variations of this. One of the voices will have the pedal
\emph{do} across both chords.\\
- DC: \textbf{V} to \textbf{vi}. The bass has \emph{sol} and \emph{la}. It you
take away the \emph{la} you end up with a PAC. Both chords have to be in root
position. \textbf{V7} to \textbf{vi} is easier to voice. Here the \textbf{vi}
is functioning as the \textbf{I} so we double the root (which is the third if
still thinking of it as the \textbf{vi}).

These cadences can be found in a progression, but if it is not at the end of
the phrase, it isn't called a cadence. IAC is like a semi colon or comma. DC
is like a question mark. PAC is very final so a period.

\hypertarget{cadences}{%
\subsection{Cadences}\label{cadences}}

A \emph{cadence} is a point of arrival that punctuates the end of a musical
unit, such as a phrase, theme, large formal section, or movement. A cadence is
at once a harmonic, melodic, rhythmic, and formal event, but cadences tend to
be grouped according to different ways in which harmony and melody articulate
that point of arrival.

\hypertarget{authentic-and-half-cadences}{%
\subsection{Authentic and half cadences}\label{authentic-and-half-cadences}}

These unit-ending points of arrival are first grouped into \emph{authentic
cadences} and \emph{half cadences}. An authentic cadence occurs when a formal
unit ends with the progression \textbf{D5--T1} (\textbf{V(7)--I}, \emph{sol}
to \emph{do} in the bass voice). If the melody accompanying this harmonic
progression arrives on \emph{do}, it is called a \emph{perfect authentic
cadence}; it the melody ends on \emph{mi} or \emph{me} (or more rarely
\emph{sol}), it is called an \emph{imperfect authentic cadence}.

Phrases that end on \textbf{V} without progressing to \textbf{I} are called
\emph{half cadences}. These cadences typically contain \emph{re} in the
melody, though \emph{ti} and \emph{sol} are also possible points of melodic
arrival. The \textbf{V} is almost invariably a triad, rather than a seventh
chord, and it is always in root position (\textbf{D5}).

Differentiating between \emph{perfect authentic cadences} (PAC),
\emph{imperfect authentic cadences} (IAC), and \emph{half cadences} (HC) by
ear and with a score is essential both to formal analysis and model
composition.

\hypertarget{simple-compound-and-double-cadences}{%
\subsection{Simple, compound, and double
cadences}\label{simple-compound-and-double-cadences}}

Writers of Italian keyboard treatises like
\href{http://faculty-web.at.northwestern.edu/music/gjerdingen/partimenti/collections/Furno/regoleP5.htm}{Furno}
and
\href{http://faculty-web.at.northwestern.edu/music/gjerdingen/partimenti/collections/Fenaroli/Regole/regoleP3.htm}{Fenaroli}
(and, more recently, American historical theorists like
\href{http://faculty-web.at.northwestern.edu/music/gjerdingen/index.htm}{Robert
O. Gjerdingen}) differentiate cadences according to the voice-leading found
over the dominant harmony. These distinctions do not replace the above
PAC/IAC/HC distinctions; rather they add another level of detail that is
particularly helpful in model composition. These voice-leading distinctions
provide three more cadence categories to complement PAC, IAC, and HC: the
\emph{simple cadence}, the \emph{compound cadence}, and the \emph{double
cadence}.

A \emph{simple cadence} occurs when the dominant harmonic function is
articulated by a single chord---either a triad or a seventh chord. The simple
cadence can be used in a PAC, IAC, or HC construction, though the
seventh-chord version is typically only found in authentic cadences.

A \emph{compound cadence} occurs when the bass note \emph{sol} of the
cadential dominant is repeated, often with the second \emph{sol} an octave
lower than the first. The compound cadence comes in three specific forms.

The first type of compound cadence involves a 4--3 suspension---\emph{do} to
\emph{ti}---over the \emph{sol} bass of the dominant harmony. In a four-voice
texture, the other two voices sustain a fifth above the bass and an octave
above the bass. The \emph{thoroughbass} figure is typically the abbreviated
4--3, which stands for 8/5/4--8/5/3 in four voices. The 4--3 suspension can
occur over the cadential dominant of a PAC, IAC, or HC.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/cadences/Compound43-full.png}
\caption{4--3 compound cadence with full thoroughbass figures.}
\end{figure}

The second type of compound cadence adds a \emph{mi/me} to \emph{re} voice
(6--5) to the above 4--3 suspension. In a four-voice texture, the bass is
doubled. The typical thoroughbass figure is 6/4--5/3, leading to the common
name for this progression, the \emph{cadential six-four}. The complete figure
is 8/6/4--8/5/3. The cadential six-four can occur over the cadential dominant
of a PAC, IAC, or HC.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/cadences/Cadential64.png}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/cadences/Cadential64-full.png}
\caption{Cadential six-four with full thoroughbass figures.}
\end{figure}

The last type of compound cadence is a special case of the cadential six-four,
where the fourth voice introduces a seventh over the second dominant chord,
rather than simply doubling the bass for both chords. This compound cadence
type requires four voices and complete thoroughbass figures of 8/6/4--7/5/3.
This figure rarely occurs over the dominant of a half cadence and is instead
reserved primarily for authentic cadences.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/cadences/Cadential64-7th.png}
\caption{Cadential six-four with seventh.}
\end{figure}

A \emph{double cadence} is a four-stage pattern over the cadential dominant
used almost exclusively in perfect authentic cadences. Though it had expired
from common use by the time of Mozart and Haydn, it was a staple for earlier
\emph{galant} composers and \emph{Classical} treatises on composition and
accompaniment. The four-stage pattern over the dominant is 5/3--6/4--5/4--5/3.
In four voices, the bass is also doubled, or a seventh can be applied to any
\emph{chord of the fifth} (i.e., not the 6/4).

\hypertarget{voice-leading-in-strict-keyboard-style}{%
\subsection{Voice-leading in strict keyboard
style}\label{voice-leading-in-strict-keyboard-style}}

In strict melodic keyboard style, always end an idealized phrase with a
perfect authentic cadence (PAC). Approach the melody's final \emph{do} by step
whenever possible, from \emph{re} or \emph{ti}, preferably from \emph{re}.
When using compound or double cadences, use the orientation of upper voices
shown in the above figures (transposed to the appropriate key, of course).

In \emph{basso continuo} style, the top voice can end with any member of the
tonic triad. As much as possible, use the voices provided in the figures
above, but invert them (move the tenor line to the top, making the melody and
alto the alto and tenor, for example). Simply make sure that if \emph{ti}
occurs in the top voice before the final tonic chord, it resolves its tendency
up to \emph{do}.

In either case, pay special attention to the cadential six-four version of the
compound cadence. Despite forming a consonant triad with the bass, both the
sixth and the fourth of the first chord act like suspensions, and therefore
\emph{must resolve down by step} and be prepared smoothly (by common tones or
steps). This is true no matter which part is in the melody, alto, or tenor.

\textbf{Tendency tones} - Root in bass goes to root of next chord - Thirds
move up by step to root of next chord - Fifths move down by step to root of
next chord - Sevenths move down by step to third of next chord

\textbf{Notes on predominant and dominant chords} - viio can also be thought
of as a V7 with no root. The voice leading functions the same way in both
chords. - IV can be thought of as a ii7 with no root. Their voice leading
functions in the same way. Keep in mind that the fa in IV resolves up to sol
the same way it would in a ii7, and \emph{not} down to mi.

Here's our nifty progressions flowchart, both in major:

iii7 -\textgreater{} vi7 -\textgreater{} {[}ii7 or IVM7{]} -\textgreater{}
{[}V7 or vii\%7{]} -\textgreater{} I -\textgreater{} (any)

IVM7 goes to I (plagal cadence); V7 goes to vi7; iii7 sometimes goes to IVM7;
vi7 sometimes goes to V7.

And minor:

IIIM7 -\textgreater{} VIM7 -\textgreater{} ii\%7 or iv7 -\textgreater{} V7 or
viio7 -\textgreater{} I -\textgreater{} (any)

Everything that happens in major, just change the chord quality and it works
in minor.

\textbf{Notes} - Notice that the dominant chords are almost the same in both
qualities. The only difference is the seventh of the seven chord. - All of
these chords will also occur as triads. The sevenths have been included in the
chart for memorization purposes. - There are also \emph{lateral progressions},
where a predominant or dominant chord will go to the other chord in its
category rather than proceeding to a dominant or tonic respectively. (I would
have included this in the chart but ran up against the limitations of text
formatting.) - Exceptions (notated in major for simplicity, but these happen
in minor too) - V -\textgreater{} vi: not always as a cadence, but don't use
this if you don't have to - IV -\textgreater{} I: almost always appears a
cadence - vi -\textgreater{} V: this can happen, but the vi should usually be
thought of as a tonic function. Avoid using this. (uncommon) - iii
-\textgreater{} IV: part of the Pachelbel's Canon progression. It is dificult
to use without creating voice leading issues. Don't use it. (rare)

\section{\texorpdfstring{From \emph{Open Music
Theory}}{From Open Music Theory}}\label{from-open-music-theory-2}}

Analyzing harmony in a piece or passage of music involves more than labeling
chords. Even the most basic analysis also involves \emph{interpreting} the way
that specific chords and progressions function within a broader context.
Ultimately, no analysis is complete until individual musical elements are
interpreted in light of the work as a whole and the historical setting in
which the piece occurs. But this resource simply walks through the steps of
performing a basic harmonic analysis, interpreting each chord and chord
progression in light of the musical phrase in which it occurs.

The first step in a harmonic analysis is to \emph{identify phrases}. For the
most part, that means beginning by identifying \emph{cadences}. However, not
every type of phrase ends with a cadence, so sensitivity to theme types is
important. In classical instrumental music, that means listening for
\href{classicalThemes.html}{period- and sentence-like structures}. In
Classical or Romantic music with text, that means listening in particular for
the ends of poetic lines and melodic phrases.

Once you have identified the musical phrases, it can be helpful to perform a
harmonic reduction (thoroughbass reduction, for example) for each phrase.
Below the score/thoroughbass line, write the appropriate Roman numeral,
\textbf{T/S/D} label for each chord, and/or an uninterpreted functional bass
symbol for each chord (\textbf{T1 T3 S4} etc.).
\href{images/Handouts/HarmoniesByBassScaleDegree.pdf}{This handout} can help
you determine the functions of chords in the thoroughbass reduction.

Next identify the general harmonic structure of each phrase. Typical phrases
in classical music will do one of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  prolong tonic without a cadence (a classical \emph{presentation} phrase, for
  example)\\
\item
  progress toward an authentic cadence (ending with \textbf{V(7) I},
  \textbf{D5 T1} in functional bass)\\
\item
  progress toward a half cadence (ending with \textbf{V}, \textbf{D5} in
  functional bass)
\end{itemize}

If the phrase prolongs tonic (no cadence), label the \emph{entire} phrase
\textbf{T------.}

If the phrase ends with a cadence, identify the \emph{cadential progression}.
This includes the last chord of the tonic zone, optionally followed by a
subdominant chord or zone (most often a single chord), and a required dominant
zone (most often a single chord or compound cadence formula). Half-cadence
phrases end there. Authentic-cadence phrases continue on to a final tonic zone
(usually a single chord).

The the \textbf{(P) D T} of the cadential progression should be labeled as
such. Once the cadential progression is identified, everything before it is
labeled as tonic prolongation. Regardless of whether it is contrapuntal
prolongation, a subsidiary progression, or a combination of the two, it will
be labeled \textbf{T------.} (See
\href{http://openmusictheory.com/harmonicSyntax2.html}{Harmonic syntax --
prolongation} if those terms are unfamiliar to you.)

Thus a phrase ending with a half cadence will have a functional analysis that
looks like:

\begin{quote}
T------------------ (P) D
\end{quote}

A phrase ending with an authentic cadence will have a functional analysis that
looks like:

\begin{quote}
T------------------ (P) D T
\end{quote}

Following is an excerpt from the opening of Haydn's Piano Sonata in C Major,
Hob. HVI:21, I. Chords are labeled with Roman numerals and a \textbf{T/S/D}
functional label for each chord. The tonic prolongation is shown below that
with a T followed by a line for the duration of the tonic zone. The cadential
progression is comprised of the last tonic chord (m. 4) through \textbf{S D T}
to the \textbf{PAC} in m. 6.

\href{/images/harmony/XVI-21-prolongation.png}{\includegraphics{/images/harmony/XVI-21-prolongation.png}}

\emph{Harmonic syntax} concerns the norms or principles according to which
harmonies (chords) are placed into meaningful successions. These norms include
progressions that are more or less common than others. Those norms generate
expectations for listeners familiar with the style: if \textbf{IV--V} is more
common than \textbf{IV--VI}, the appearance of a \textbf{IV} chord generates
an expectation that the next chord is more likely to be \textbf{V} than it is
to be \textbf{VI}.

In Western classical music, harmonies generally group into three
\emph{harmonic functions} --- tonic (T), subdominant (S), and dominant (D) ---
and these functions group together chords that progress to and from other
chords in similar ways. For example, since \textbf{II} and \textbf{IV} are
both subdominant chords, they will participate in many of the same kinds of
chord progressions, and at times can be substituted for each other with only a
minimal change to the musical effect.

On a local level (chord-to-chord progressions), we can summarize the
tendencies of these functions with the cycle \textbf{T--S--D--T}. That is,
harmonies tend to progress through a cyclical progression of those three
functions:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{T → S → D → T →} and so on . . .
\end{quote}

That does not rule out T progressing to D, D progressing to S, etc. But it
does mean that those progressions tend to be less common, at least in
classical music.

Higher-level musical structures also impact the norms according to which these
harmonic functions progress. For now, we will consider one higher-level
structure that influences chord-progression tendencies --- the phrase --- and
we will limit our study to isolated, complete, self-sufficient phrases. This
is an idealized, oversimplified setting --- like strict voice-leading --- that
is useful for learning the basics. Some such phrases even exist in real music!
But most of the time there are a number of competing factors that influence
the chord-progression strategies employed by a composer at any given moment.
However, the idealized phrase is a helpful starting point. Future study will
explore how classical composers employ harmonic progressions in larger musical
works that combine multiple phrases (which are not self-sufficient) into
larger themes and movements.

\hypertarget{the-idealized-phrase}{%
\section{The idealized phrase}\label{the-idealized-phrase}}

The \emph{idealized phrase} (also called the \emph{phrase model}) is a single
musical phrase that progresses through an entire cycle of harmonic functions,
beginning and ending on tonic. (Strict voice-leading exercises are such
phrases.) These phrases begin with a point of stability (tonic), move away
from that stable point, and then eventually lead to a point of high tension
and resolution (an \emph{authentic cadence}). This pattern of
stability--instability--stability, or rest--motion--rest, with a single goal
at the end, should be familiar both from species counterpoint and from strict
keyboard-style voice-leading. (This pattern also governs large-scale formal
structures in classical music.)

The simplest phrase that exhibits this complete harmonic cycle is a
tonic-dominant-tonic progression: \textbf{I--V--I.} This phrase begins and
ends with the most stable harmony (\textbf{I}), and includes an
\emph{authentic cadence} (\textbf{V--I}). The \textbf{V} is the high point of
instability, containing the tendency tone (\emph{ti}) that most strongly
points to the final point of arrival (\emph{do}, or tonic).

This harmonic cycle can be expanded by inserting a subdominant chord, a
destabilized tonic chord, or both, as in the following examples:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{I IV V I}\\
\textbf{I II V I}\\
\textbf{I VI V I}\\
\textbf{I VI II V I}
\end{quote}

In \emph{functional bass} terms, any harmonic progression that follows the
pattern

\begin{quote}
\textbf{T1 → (S\_) → D5 → T1}
\end{quote}

can serve as the basis for a complete idealized phrase. (Harmonies in
parentheses are optional.)

Phrases are seldom 3--5 chords long, however, and a harmonic function can be
expressed by more than a single chord. Thus we can understand the harmonic
functions not simply as chords, but as \emph{zones} of varying length in a
phrase, which can be created by a number of chords or short chord
progressions. More generally, then, our idealized musical phrase contains a
single progression of functional zones \textbf{T → (S) → D → T}, begins with
\textbf{T1}, and ends with an authentic cadence (\textbf{D5--T1}), as seen in
the example below.

\hypertarget{triggering-and-prolonging-harmonic-functions-in-an-idealized-phrase}{%
\section{Triggering and prolonging harmonic functions in an idealized
phrase}\label{triggering-and-prolonging-harmonic-functions-in-an-idealized-phrase}}

To establish, or trigger, a harmonic functional zone, composers tend to use
\emph{a fixed scale degree in the bass}. In other words, tonic tends to be
triggered by \textbf{T1} (always \textbf{I}), subdominant by \textbf{S2} or
\textbf{S4} (including a variety of \textbf{II} and \textbf{IV} chords, in in
root position or inversions, with and without sevenths), and dominant by
\textbf{D5} (\textbf{V}, with or without a seventh, or a
\href{cadenceTypes}{\emph{compound cadence}}). These four categories of chords
--- \textbf{T1}, \textbf{S2}, \textbf{S4}, and \textbf{D5} --- are called
\emph{functional chords} (because they trigger the function) or
\emph{cadential chords} (because they can participate in a cadence).

Other chords are often called \emph{contrapuntal chords} or \emph{embellishing
chords}, and are typically used to \emph{prolong} a function throughout the
zone.

Functional prolongations are shown in a harmonic analysis by writing/typing T,
S, or D underneath the individual chord labels (Roman numerals or functional
bass) and extending a line from the beginning of the functional zone to the
end.

The following excerpt is from Mozart's Piano Sonata in A Major, K. 331, I.,
mm. 1--4, with a harmonic reduction and analysis provided below the original
score. Such an analysis is called an \emph{interpreted} harmonic analysis,
because the harmonies are interpreted according to the way they behave in the
phrase, rather than merely labeled. In this phrase, note the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The tonic zone is triggered by a root-position tonic triad (\textbf{I} or
  \textbf{T1}).\\
\item
  Contrapuntal dominant chords (\textbf{D7} --- first-inversion dominant
  chords) create a passing bass motion between the opening \textbf{I} chord,
  the \textbf{vi} in m. 3, and the return of \textbf{I} in m. 4.\\
\item
  The \href{harmonicAnalysis}{cadential progression} begins in m. 4 with the
  move from \textbf{I} to ii6 (\textbf{S4}) and then to the cadential six-four
  and dominant triad (\textbf{D5}). Note that the entirety of the cadential
  progression in m. 4 is made up of \emph{cadential chords} --- chords with
  fixed scale degrees in the bass.\\
\item
  In contrast, the entire tonic-prolongation zone is made up of
  \emph{contrapuntal chords} --- variable scale degrees in the bass --- with
  the exception of the \textbf{I} chord that triggered the tonic function.\\
\item
  The \textbf{vi} chord is a root-position chord, but still an embellishing
  chord, while the ii6 is an inverted chord, but still a functional/cadential
  chord. The difference is not the inversion, but the scale degree of the
  bass.
\end{itemize}

\href{/images/harmony/k331-reduction.png}{\includegraphics{/images/harmony/k331-reduction.png}}

Not all classical phrases as neatly fit the general trends outlined in this
resource. As discussed in \href{tendency}{Style and tendency}, the principles
of harmonic syntax are both reliable and bendable/breakable, and it is often
the music that bends/breaks the ``rules'' in interesting ways that we care
about the most. So in your own analyses, keep these principles in mind as
\emph{general} principles, and simultaneously look for where composers meet
these expectations as well as where they break them.

classical phrase, see \href{harmonicSyntax2}{Harmonic syntax -- prolongation}.

\textbf{How do we harmonize a melody?} - Pick a key - Figure out the harmonic
rhythm - Determine where and what type your cadences are (type determined by
notes in melody. Ex: in C, if our last notes in the soprano are B and C we
can't have a plagal cadence because there is no ti in IV) - Harmonies (using
circle of fifths progressions) - Bassline - Inner voices

\textbf{When in doubt: K.I.S.S.} - Focusing on smooth voice leading, correct
doubling, and correct tendency tone resolutions will make this process a lot
easier! If your voice leading is good, you avoid dealing with a lot of errors
because they're symptoms of bad voice leading

\textbf{A first attempt at part-writing} - Possible progression: I - ii - V7 -
I - As you fill in notes, be making sure all chord members are present. Triads
always need the third. Seventh chords always need the third and the seventh. -
Voicing of the last chord (C's in SAB, E in T) isn't ideal. It's very spread
out and there's a third between B and T, which can make the chord sound
muddier than if it were somewhere between the upper three voices. This
happened because of repeated tones in previous chords - When determining your
voicings, think of the harmonic series! There's a lot of space between the
lower notes but there's progressively less the higher you go. If you try to
emulate this in your voicings, you'll end up with better sounding, stronger
parts that are less prone to errors

\hypertarget{class-discussion-4}{%
\chapter{Class discussion}\label{class-discussion-4}}

\textbf{Written pitch}: what is written on the page. If you're playing a
transposed instrument, the note you are playing will be transposed too.

\textbf{Sounding pitch}: the ``actual'' note being played. Concert A is
concert A no matter what instrument you're playing.

\textbf{Concert pitch}: interchangeable with sounding pitch. Basically means
``in C.'' This is the baseline point of reference for everything else.

Remember that the process of transposition relies on compensation. If an
instrument is pitched lower, its written pitches are \emph{higher} than
concert pitch. Ex: Bb trumpet's written C is concert Bb.

\textbf{Ranges} There is a range and transposition handout to print out that
is very handy! It is in lesson 12a. It has very conservative ranges though for
Brass instruments. It has nice normal ranges for everything.

\textbf{Transposition hints} You can organize various instruments according to
how their music is written: - \textbf{C instruments}: written/sounding pitches
match! These are the easy ones. - \textbf{Octave displacing instruments}:
instruments play up or down an octave from what is written. Generally high
instruments get written an octave lower(to sound higher), and low instruments
get written an octave higher (to sound lower) (think about compensation like
we talked about earlier!). - \textbf{Bb instruments}: transpose(sounds) down a
M2 from written pitch. Some instruments (like tenor sax) have an additional
octave displacement.You have to write a step higher,so it sounds a step lower.
- \textbf{Eb instruments}: transposition is based around M6. Some instruments
have octave displacements, and Eb clarinet is transposed up a m3 from written.
This one is the only exception of transposing up. Baritone sax has a pretty
easy trick for transposing it! - Quick way to remember what keys the
saxophones are in: organize them ascending to descending and they will
alternate Bb and Eb (soprano, alto, tenor, bari). Or think of soprano/tenor
and alto/bari as pairs. - \textbf{F instruments}: transpose down a P5 from
written pitch. - Others - \textbf{Clarinet in A}: down a m3 from written pitch
- \textbf{Alto flute}: written in G, transpose down a P4 from written pitch.
(will not have to deal this semester with this)

\hypertarget{class-discussion-5}{%
\chapter{Class discussion}\label{class-discussion-5}}

\textbf{Homophony vs Polyphony} - Homophonic textures is created when one or
multiple voices are all singing around the same central idea. - Polyphony is
present when inner voices other than the melody are present and have rhythms
and pitches that are more contrasting from the main melody.

\textbf{Define counterpoint:} - Strict voice leading; lots of rules to follow?
(On the right track: it's definitely a very strict system) - \emph{Studying
melody}, specifically studying melody that is \emph{two melodies happening at
the same time}

\textbf{Intervals} - Harmonic Interval: An interval created from two notes
that are vertically stacked - Melodic Interval: An interval created from two
notes that are adjacent (one note after the other) - Perfect consonances: P1,
P5, P8 - Imperfect consonances: M3, m3, M6, m6 - A note: ``consonant'' and
``dissonant'' in this style = ``allowed'' and ``not allowed.'' P5s, P8s, M3s,
etc. are allowed, whereas P4s are not.

\textbf{Types of contrapuntal motion} - Parallel: same direction of melodic
interval, same size harmonic interval (not necessarily the same
\emph{quality}) - Contrary: opposite direction of motion, intervals don't
matter - Oblique: one voice is stationary, the other moves - Static: no
movement in either voice - Similar: same direction, different harmonic
interval sizes

\hypertarget{types-of-contrapuntal-motion}{%
\subsection{Types of contrapuntal motion}\label{types-of-contrapuntal-motion}}

There are four types of contrapuntal motion between two musical lines.
Differentiating these four types of motion is essential to generating good
voice-leading, both strict and free.

In \emph{parallel motion}, two voices move in the same direction by the same
generic interval. For example, the following two voices both move up by a
step. Note also that both dyads form the same generic interval (sixth). This
will always be true when two voices move in parallel motion.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/intervals/parallel.png}
\caption{Example of parallel motion: C--A to D--B.}
\end{figure}

In \emph{similar motion}, also called \emph{direct motion}, two voices move in
the same direction, but by different intervals. For example, the following two
voices both move down, but the upper voice moves by step while the lower voice
moves by leap. Note also that the two dyads are different generic intervals.
This will always be the case with similar or direct motion.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/intervals/similar.png}
\caption{Example of similar motion: C--G to A--F.}
\end{figure}

In \emph{contrary motion}, two voices move in opposite directions---one up,
the other down.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/intervals/contrary.png}
\caption{Example of contrary motion: C--E to A--F.}
\end{figure}

In \emph{oblique motion}, one voice is stationary, while the other voice moves
(in either direction). The stationary tone may or may not be rearticulated.

\hypertarget{class-discussion-6}{%
\section{Class discussion}\label{class-discussion-6}}

There are three parts: Preparation (before non chord tone), the non-chord tone
itself, and the resolution (note after the non-chord tone). - The preparation
and resolutions are always chord tones. If there are multiple non-chord tones,
it means you have analyzed something an the pattern is wrong.

Non-chord tones can be: - Accented vs unaccented - On-chord vs off-chord -
Chromatic vs diatonic - Ascending vs descending (passing tones only) - Upper
vs lower (neighbor tones only)

\textbf{Passing Tone (PT)} Is approached by step and left by step in the same
direction. Ex: Both preparation and resolution are moving down(or the opposite
direction).

\textbf{Neighbor Tone (NT)} Is approached by step and left by step in the
opposite direction. Ex: The preparation moves down and the resolution returns
back up(or the opposite for each).

\textbf{Suspension (SUS)} Is approached by static motion and resolves downward
by step. \textbf{All suspensions require two chords} as the preparation will
be on a different chord than the NCT itself. You have to have this downward
motion. If you don't, you may have to alter the chord when inserting a
suspension. We label how suspensions resolve with its intervalic label.
Anything above the bass voice, you write the interval of the two notes of the
suspension against the bass note.Ex: C in the bass with a D to C resolution in
the alto voice is a ``Sus 9-8.'' If this example occurs in the tenor voice, it
is considered 2-1. The most common suspensions are 4-3, 7-6, 9-8.

If the suspension is in the bass, you measure it against the most dissonant
voice. They will always be labeled 2-3 because there will always be a second.
Also note that the numbers get bigger when labeling. (4-3 vs 2-3)

\textbf{Retardation (RET)} Is approached by static motion and resolves upward
by step. You can think of it as a suspension that resolves up. It follows all
of the same rules. These are much \textbf{less} common.

\subsection{Notes}\label{notes}}

When written on a staff, a note indicates a pitch and rhythmic value. The
notation consists of a \emph{notehead} (either empty or filled in), and
optionally can include a \emph{stem}, \emph{beam}, \emph{dot}, or \emph{flag}.

\hypertarget{staff}{%
\subsection{Staff}\label{staff}}

Notes can't convey their pitch information without being placed on a staff. A
staff consists of five horizontal lines, evenly spaced. The plural of staff is
\emph{staves}.

\hypertarget{clefs-2}{%
\subsection{Clefs}\label{clefs-2}}

Notes \emph{still} can't convey their pitch information if the staff doesn't
include a clef. A clef indicates which pitches are assigned to the lines and
spaces on a staff. The two most commonly used clefs are the \emph{treble} and
\emph{bass} clef; others that you'll see relatively frequently are \emph{alto}
and \emph{tenor} clef.

\hypertarget{grand-staff}{%
\subsection{Grand staff}\label{grand-staff}}

The grand staff consists of two staves, one that uses a treble clef, and one
that uses a bass clef. The staves are connected by a curly brace. Grand staves
are used frequently for notating piano music and other polyphonic instruments.

\hypertarget{ledger-lines}{%
\subsection{Ledger lines}\label{ledger-lines}}

When the music's range exceeds what can be written on the staff, extra lines
are drawn so that we can still clearly read the pitch. These extra lines are
called \emph{ledger lines.} In the example below, From Haydn's Piano Sonata in
G (Hob. XVI: 39), A-flat5 occurs just above the treble staff in the right
hand, and G3 and B3 occur just below the treble staff in the left hand.

\hypertarget{accidentals}{%
\subsection{Accidentals}\label{accidentals}}

Accidentals are used to indicate when a pitch has been raised or lowered. They
are written to the \emph{left} of the pitch.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When you lower one of the white notes of the piano by a semitone, you add a
  flat.
\item
  When you raise one of the white notes of the piano by a semitone, you add a
  sharp.
\item
  When you raise a note that is already flat by a semitone, you add a natural.
\item
  When you lower a note that is already flat by a semitone, you add a double
  flat.
\item
  When you raise a note that is already sharp by a semitone, you add a double
  sharp.
\end{itemize}

The example below shows the symbols for flat, natural, sharp, double sharp,
and double flat, respectively.

\emph{Note that the seventh dimnished chord and major V in \textbf{minor}
needs the leading tone (ti) in diatonic harmony.}

\textbf{What does Cmin7/E-flat tell us?} - First inversion, E-flat is in the
bass - All 4 chord members (C Eb G Bb) - We \emph{do not} know what key we are
in and how this chord functions within the key. It is completely removed from
form

\textbf{Roman numerals} - The roman numeral itself identifies the root. You
can tell what note the root is because its number correlates directly to its
scale degree. For example, in C major vi indicates an A minor chord because A
is the sixth scale degree in that key. As we'll see in a second, the root can
be altered just like the other chord members - Uppercase/lowercase identifies
the third in relation to the root (major/minor) - 5ths are assumed perfect
unless there's a +, a half-diminished, or a diminished sign in the superscript
- The diminished sign is special because it indicates that both the fifth and
seventh are lowered. You can tell the difference from the half-diminished sign
because the latter has a slash through it (it's cut in ``half'') - 7 by itself
= dominant 7th. Can be altered with M, a half-diminished, or a diminished sign
- Sometimes chords like IV7 are notated without the clarification that it's a
major seventh chord--you're expected to know because a major seventh is
diatonic. However, when we get past the Classical era this method breaks down
because all kinds of crazy stuff starts happening with harmony from the
Romantic era onward

\textbf{Altering Roman numerals for non-diatonic chord qualities} - Can have
any triad in any key as long as you know how it relates to the key -
Accidental in front alters the chord from its diatonic version. Ex: in C
major, bVI = Ab major chord - Only sharps and flats are used this way--no
naturals. Even in sharp keys, you would use a flat sign to indicate a lowered
chord. Likewise, a sharp indicates a raised chord even in flat keys

\hypertarget{labeling-chords}{%
\section{Labeling chords}\label{labeling-chords}}

There are two ways in which we will label chords according to function. The
first is to label chords with Roman numerals, thoroughbass figures, and
functional labels. When doing so, place the appropriate Roman numeral
\emph{below} the bass line, the thoroughbass figure \emph{above} the bass line
(since it represents the upper voices), and place a functional label
\textbf{T}/\textbf{S}/\textbf{D} below the Roman numeral (no \textbf{Tx};
simply call a \textbf{VI} chord \textbf{T}). For now this label can simply
apply T, S, or D to individual chords; in the future, we will alter this
practice slightly in order to show \href{harmonicSyntax2.html}{functional
prolongation}. The first example shows individual chord functions, and the
second example shows functional prolongation.

\href{/images/harmony/RNsIndividualFunctions.png}{\includegraphics{/images/harmony/RNsIndividualFunctions.png}}

\href{/images/harmony/RNsFunctionalProlongation.png}{\includegraphics{/images/harmony/RNsFunctionalProlongation.png}}

The second way to label a harmonic progression is what Quinn calls
\emph{functional bass}. Functional bass symbols combine a chord's function
(\textbf{T}, \textbf{S}, \textbf{D}, or \textbf{Tx}) with an Arabic numeral
denoting the scale degree of its bass note. A tonic chord with \emph{do} in
the bass is \textbf{T1}, a dominant chord with \emph{ti} in the bass is
\textbf{D7}, etc. If the bass note is chromatically altered, use a \textbf{+}
or \textbf{--} to denote raised or lowered (\emph{la} and \emph{ti} in minor
do not count, since \emph{le}, \emph{la}, \emph{te}, and \emph{ti} all belong
to minor, but you can use +/-- for clarity if you like). And if there is a
chromatically altered note anywhere in the chord, put the functional bass
symbol inside square brackets: \textbf{{[}S6{]}}, \textbf{{[}S+4{]}},
\textbf{{[}T--7{]}}, etc. (See \href{alteredSubdominants.html}{Chromatically
altered subdominant chords}, \href{appliedChords.html}{Applied chords}, and
\href{modalMixture.html}{Modal mixture} for more information on common
chromatically altered chords.)

\href{/images/harmony/FunctionalBassFunctions.png}{\includegraphics{/images/harmony/FunctionalBassFunctions.png}}

Quinn also advocates using what I call \emph{interpreted functional bass}.
This nomenclature uses the same symbols, but uses parentheses to denote
\href{http://openmusictheory.com/harmonicSyntax2.html}{\emph{contrapuntal
prolongation}} and lower-case postscripts to explain the contrapuntal role of
the embellishing chord (p for passing, n for neighbor, i for incomplete
neighbor, d for divider, e for embellishing --- all of these refer to the
voice-leading pattern in the bass voice). Following is an example of
interpreted functional bass.

\href{/images/harmony/InterpretedFunctionalBass.png}{\includegraphics{/images/harmony/InterpretedFunctionalBass.png}}

In this text, we primarily use the first method of Roman numerals and
(prolonged) harmonic functions, since it is the most common in North American
music theory. However, functional bass can be helpful for identifying
categories of chords that belong together. For example, in a dictation or
transcription task, we might hear \emph{re} in the bass but not know what
specific chord it is. If context tells us it is likely a dominant chord,
rather than subdominant, we can label it \textbf{D2}. This rules out
\textbf{II} (a subdominant chord) but keeps open multiple dominant options
like \textbf{V6/4} or \textbf{VII6} until we are able to make a final
determination. Similarly, when composing, there are patterns that might take
an \textbf{S4}, with the specific chord (\textbf{IV} or \textbf{II6})
determined by voice-leading rather than harmonic syntax, but where a
\textbf{D4} chord (\textbf{V4/2}) would be syntactically inappropriate,
regardless of voice-leading.

Thus, when referring to specific chords, we will use Roman numerals to label
the chords and functional labels to interpret their role in context. When
referring to broader categories of chords, we will more often use functional
bass.

\textbf{Pentatonic Scales Tricks}

-Take out the tri-tone notes (Degree 4 and 7) from the major scale for major
pentatonic.

-Minor pentatonic can be remembered as taking out scale degree 2 and 6.

-Major and Minor are the same pitches, but just organized in a different order
(different starting point). They are modes of each other.

\textbf{Bobby McFerrin Video}

He could demonstrate that the pentatonic scale can be used independently and
easily taught.

Even though it is missing the two notes that we considered important scale
degrees, if can still be expressive and interesting (and it is in our bones).

\section{\texorpdfstring{From \emph{Open Music

A scale is a succession of pitches ascending or descending in steps. There are
two types of steps: \emph{half steps} and \emph{whole steps}. A half step (H)
consists of two adjacent pitches on the keyboard. A whole step (W) consists of
two half steps. Usually, the pitches in a scale are each notated with
different letter names, though this isn't always possible or desirable.

\hypertarget{the-major-scale}{%
\subsection{The major scale}\label{the-major-scale}}

A major scale, a sound with which you are undoubtedly familiar, consists of
seven whole (W) and half (H) steps in the following succession: W-W-H-W-W-W-H.
The first pitch of the scale, called the \emph{tonic}, is the pitch upon which
the rest of the scale is based. When the scale ascends, the tonic is repeated
at the end an octave higher.

Here is the D major scale. It is called the ``D major scale'' because the
pitch D is the \emph{tonic} and is heard at both ends of the scale.

\hypertarget{scale-degrees-and-solfuxe8ge}{%
\subsection{Scale degrees and solfège}\label{scale-degrees-and-solfuxe8ge}}

While ISO notation allows us to label a pitch in its specific register, it is
often useful to know where that pitch fits within a given scale. For example,
the pitch class D is the first (and last) note of the D-major scale. The pitch
class A is the fifth note of the D-major scale. When described in this way, we
call the notes \emph{scale degrees}, because they're placed in context of a
specific scale. Solfège syllables,
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solfège}{a centuries-old method of teaching
pitch and sight singing}, can also be used to represent scale degrees (when
used in this way, this system is specifically called movable-\emph{do}
solfège).

Scale degrees are labeled with Arabic numerals and carets (\^{}). The
illustration below shows a D-major scale and corresponding ISO notation, scale
degrees, and solfège syllables.

\hypertarget{the-minor-scale}{%
\subsection{The minor scale}\label{the-minor-scale}}

Another scale with which you are likely very familiar is the minor scale.
There are several scales that one might describe as \emph{minor}, all of which
have a characteristic third scale degree that is lower than the one found in
the major scale. The minor scale most frequently used in tonal music from the
Common Practice period is based on the \emph{aeolian mode} (you'll read more
about modes later), which is sometimes referred to as the \emph{natural minor}
scale.

The natural minor scale consists of seven whole (W) and half (H) steps in the
following succession: W-H-W-W-H-W-W. Note the changes in solfège syllables.

If you sing through the above example, you'll notice that the ending lacks the
same sense of closure you heard in the major scale. This closure is created in
the major scale, in part, by the ascending semitone between \emph{ti} and
\emph{do}. Composers often want to have this sense of closure when using the
minor mode, too. They're able to achieve this by applying an accidental to the
seventh scale degree, raising it by a semitone. If you do this within the
context of the natural minor scale, you get something called the
\emph{harmonic minor} scale.

Now the last two notes of the scale sound much more conclusive, but you might
have found it difficult to sing \emph{le} to \emph{ti}. When writing melodies
in a minor key, composers often ``corrected'' this by raising \emph{le} by a
semitone to become \emph{la} when approaching the note \emph{ti}. When the
melody descended from \emph{do}, the closure from \emph{ti} to \emph{do} isn't
needed; likewise, it is no longer necessary to ``correct'' \emph{le}, so the
natural form of the minor scale is used again. Together, these different
ascending and descending versions are called the \emph{melodic minor} scale.

When ascending, the \emph{melodic minor} scale uses \emph{la} and \emph{ti}.

When descending, the \emph{melodic minor} scale uses the ``natural'' \emph{te}
and \emph{le}.

Truth be told, most composers don't really think about three different
``forms'' of the minor scale. The \emph{harmonic minor} scale simply
represents composers' tendency to use \emph{ti} when building harmonies that
include the seventh scale degree in the minor mode. Likewise, the
\emph{melodic minor} scale is derived from composers' desire to avoid the
melodic augmented second interval (more on this in the
\href{intervals.html}{intervals} section) between \emph{le} and \emph{ti} (and
some chose not to avoid this!). In reality, there is only one ``version'' of
the minor scale. Context determines when a composer might use \emph{la} and
\emph{ti} when writing music in a minor key.

\textbf{What is rhythm?} - A division of the beat. (What's a beat? A division
of time\ldots etc etc forever and ever) - \emph{Rhythm is the temporal aspect
of music}

\textbf{What does rhythm communicate?} - ``When you play what'' - ``How long
you play what when you play it'' - ``When and when not''\ldots sound and
silence\ldots when things start and stop (\emph{especially} the ``and stop''
part)

\textbf{What do time signatures represent?} - Meter! - Meter -\textgreater{}
Beats -\textgreater{} Division -\textgreater{} Subdivision

\textbf{What's a measure?} - A defined space that can only hold as many beats
as the meter allows - A meter is defined by the beats!

\textbf{What is a regular meter?} - Can be divided into two? (Nope, too
specific) - Beats are divided evenly? \emph{Something} is divided evenly? -
\emph{All the beats are the same length} - Examples: 4/4 and 3/4 are regular,
whereas 5/8 is irregular\ldots unless the tempo is eighth note = whatever

\textbf{What is a simple meter?} - Any time signature that has a 2, 3, or 4 in
the denominator? (No: on the right track, though!) - Beats hold equal value
(No: this is a regular meter) - Number of beats in measure = numerator? (Not
quite: getting into the top/bottom number meanings, though) - \emph{Basic
division of a beat is 2}

\textbf{What do the top and bottom numbers mean in a simple time signature?} -
Top = number of beats in a measure - Bottom = note value that ``gets'' the
beat - What do we mean by ``get?'' How do we explain this to beginning
musicians? - ``How many'' (top) and ``what kind'' (bottom) - Think of it as an
actual fraction. Replace the top number with a 1 and it will reveal what kind
of note is the beat

\textbf{What do duple, triple, and quadruple mean when describing a meter?} -
\emph{How many beats are in a measure.} Duple has 2, triple as 3, etc.
Phrasing is ``simple x,'' for example 4/4 is simple quadruple.

\textbf{What is the ``theoretically ideal'' rhythmic notation of beaming in
simple meters?} - Ideal: show where the beats are, common: easier to sight
read? (Yes\ldots though the second part's subjective) - Why is this helpful in
a theory class with a lot of analysis? - Can clearly see every beat, makes it
easier to discuss - Being able to see every beat can make it easier to stack
chords when analyzing. You can see all the notes in each beat, so you are less
likely to miss a sustained note from a previous beat.

\textbf{A list of common meters in simple duple, triple, and quadruple:} -
Quadruple: 4/32, 4/1 - Basicaly: you can have ``simple x-uple'' for any
numbers of beat! Simple quintuple, simple octuple, etc.

Rhythm refers to the combination of long and short durations in time.
Durations are notated with either unfilled or filled noteheads. Unfilled
noteheads can appear with or without a stem; filled noteheads always appear
with a stem. Flags can be added to the stems of filled noteheads; each flag
shortens the duration by half.

\hypertarget{rests}{%
\subsection{Rests}\label{rests}}

Rests represent silence in musical notation. For each durational symbol there
exists a corresponding rest.

\hypertarget{dots-and-ties}{%
\subsection{Dots and ties}\label{dots-and-ties}}

Dots and ties allow for basic durations to be lengthened. A dot occurs after a
pitch or a rest, and it increases its duration by half. For example, if a
quarter note is equivalent in duration to two eighth notes, a dotted quarter
note would be equivalent to \emph{three} eighth notes. Generally, undotted
notes divide into two notes; dotted notes divide into three. Thus, undotted
notes are typically used to represent the beat level in simple meter, while
dotted notes are used to represent the beat in compound meter.

Multiple dots can be added to a duration. Subsequent dots add half the
duration of the previous dot. For example, a quarter note with two dots would
be equivalent in duration to a quarter, eighth, and sixteenth note.

A \emph{tie} lengthens a duration by connecting two adjacent identical
pitches. Ties are used to either sustain a pitch beyond the length of a single
measure, or to make a particular rhythmic grouping in a measure more clear.

In the example below, the duration of the first pitch is longer than a single
measure, so it is represented by tying the dotted half note, which lasts the
full measure, to the first beat of the subsequent measure.

\hypertarget{meters}{%
\subsection{Meters}\label{meters}}

Meter involves the way multiple pulse layers work together to organize music
in time. Standard meters in Western music can be classified into \emph{simple
meters} and \emph{compound meters}, as well as \emph{duple}, \emph{triple},
and \emph{quadruple} meters.

Duple, triple, and quadruple classifications result from the relationship
between the counting pulse and the pulses that are \emph{slower} than the
counting pulse. In other words, it is a question of \emph{grouping}: how many
beats occur in each bar. If counting-pulse beats group into twos, we have
duple meter; groups of three, triple meter; groups of four, quadruple meter.
Conducting patterns are determined based on these classifications.

Simple and compound classifications result from the relationship between the
counting pulse and the pulses that are \emph{faster} than the counting pulse.
In other words, it is a question of \emph{division}: does each beat divide
into two equal parts, or three equal parts. Meters that divide the beat into
two equal parts are \emph{simple meters}.

There are three types of standard simple meters in Western music:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  simple duple (beats group into two, divide into two)
\item
  simple triple (beats group into three, divide into two)
\item
  simple quadruple (beats group into four, divide into two)
\end{itemize}

In a time signature, the \emph{top number} (and the top number only!)
describes the type of meter. Following are the top numbers that always
correspond to each type of meter:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  simple duple: 2
\item
  simple triple: 3
\item
  simple quadruple: 4
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{notating-meter}{%
\section{Notating meter}\label{notating-meter}}

In \emph{simple meters}, the bottom number of the time signature corresponds
to the type of note corresponding to \emph{a single beat}. If a simple meter
is notated such that each quarter note corresponds to a beat, the bottom
number of the time signature is 4. If a simple meter is notated such that each
half note corresponds to a beat, the bottom number of the time signature is 2.
If a simple meter is notated such that each eighth note corresponds to a beat,
the bottom number of the time signature is 8. And so on.

\hypertarget{beaming}{%
\section{Beaming}\label{beaming}}

It's important to remember that notation is intended to be read by performers.
You should always strive to make your notation as easy to interpret as
possible. Part of this includes grouping the rhythms such that they convey the
beat unit and the beat division. \emph{Beams} are used to group any notes at
the beat division level or shorter that fall within the same beat.

In this example, the eighth notes are not grouped with beams, making it
difficult to interpret the triple meter.

If we re-notate the above example so that the notes that fall within the same
beat are grouped together with a beam, it makes the music much easier to read.

\hypertarget{borrowed-divisions}{%
\subsection{Borrowed divisions}\label{borrowed-divisions}}

Typically, a meter is defined by the presence of a consistent beat division:
division by two in simple meter, and by three in compound meter. Occasionally,
composers will use a triple division of the beat in a simple meter, or a duple
division of the beat in a compound meter.

\emph{Triplets} are borrowed from compound meter, and may occur at both the
beat division and subdivision levels, as seen below.

Likewise, \emph{duplets} can be imported from simple meter into a compound
meter.

\textbf{\emph{Melodic sequences}}

\textbf{Diatonic vs.~chromatic} - Diatonic is entirely in the key. The first
example is completely in C, so it's diatonic. When a sequence is diatonic you
don't label the quality of the interval of transposition because it will vary
between each scale degree - For chromatic sequences, you have to label the
interval \emph{with} its quality because that determines the ``key'' - Always
be thinking about the smallest possible pattern to identify! In example 4, the
sequence can technically be a whole beat \emph{or} half a beat. However, it is
suggested to ID it as being half a beat because that's simpler (especially if
you're expected to write out the rest)

\textbf{Ascending vs.~descending} - Intervals within the pattern will be
ascending or descending, but the only thing we care about is the interval
transposition, or the \emph{overall} motion between each sequence. The second
example is a descending sequence because the overall transposition is down by
a second

Some sequences will have qualities of diatonic and chromatic sequences. Ex.
5's inner intervals are fixed, the same as in a chromatic sequence, but the
interval of transposition is a ``diatonic third,'' descending in thirds down
the C major scale.

\textbf{How to label sequences:} put a bracket over the top of the areas you
want to ID as a sequence, then draw arrows pointing from the one on the left
to the one on the right. Over the top of the arrow, indicate whether it's
ascending/descending with an up or down arrow, and also include a number (and
quality, if the sequence is chromatic) to ID the interval of transposition.

\textbf{\emph{Harmonic sequences}}

\textbf{A two voice sequence} - Is this example functional? Can you harmonize
the example (come up with a progression for it)? Can we have a cadence as we
normally would? - Sequences don't have to follow functional tonal harmony
rules, which is why it's okay for us to have a V6/4 as our penultimate chord
in this example. It's like how passing chords don't have to follow
circle-of-fifths progression rules, except it's all the time - Adding the alto
voice - This also ends up being a sequence! From the second measure, the
pattern is down a third + up a second, or an overall transposition interval of
a second

\textbf{Common sequences} - Parallel 6 chords - Made entirely of first
inversion chords. Goal is a smooth + strong bassline - Always descending -
Pachelbel's sequence - Suuuuuuuper prevalent, you hear it everywhere - This is
the reason we have iii -\textgreater{} IV in our chord progression chart! This
progression works in Pachelbel's Canon in D and is used widely even today

Tertian Harmnoy: Harmony based on stacked thirds. \emph{(diatonic triad,
stacked thirds, is not necessarily the same as a ``triad''-implies any
collection of three pitches)}

\textbf{ID Triads?} - M: M3 + m3 (P5 outside) - m: m3 + M3 (P5 outside) - d:
m3 + m3 (d5 outside) - A: M3 + M3 (A5 outside)

Note that all 3rds are either major or minor! Don't even worry about
diminished thirds.

Additional tips: - Knowing your scales can help identify triads, especially in
a key with lots of sharps or flats where many of the possible altered notes
are double sharps or flats. - Possible groupings for memorization - M and A
both ``start'' with a M3, m and d both start with a m3 - M and m are more
familiar whereas A and d are newer and ``weirder,'' have altered 5ths

\textbf{ID inversions?} - Root position: starting point (stacked thirds) -
Determine the quality of the third and the quality of the fifth to find the
quality of the chord. - 1st inversion: take the root and move it to the top
(3rd is on the bottom) - 2nd inversion: take the third and move it to the top
(5th is on the bottom)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The only thing that determines your inversion is the lowest/bass pitched
  note. \emph{(note that when actually labeling inversions, the numbers will
  be superscript and stacked)}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{ID closed vs open voicing?} - Closed voicing = closest notes can be
notated together on a staff, open = spread out? (No: ``spread out'' is not
specific enough) - Closed voicing = voices within a 4th, open = voices larger
apart than a 4th? (On the right track, but not quite!) - Closed voicing =
within an octave, open voicing = greater than an octave?

These are all good guesses, but closed voicing means stacking all chord
members in ascending order without skipping over any of them. Open voicing is
anything \emph{but} that.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Open voicing = does not have the first/third/fifth in the same octave.
\item
  Closed is in the same octave and stacked as closely to the bottom as
  possible. There are no skipped pitches.
\end{itemize}

Voicing is important because it changes how the listener hears something. Open
has a more broad and expansive sound while closed is more final.

A chord is any combination of three or more pitch classes that sound
simultaneously.

A three-note chord whose pitch classes can be arranged as thirds is called a
\emph{triad}.

To quickly determine whether a three-note chord is a triad, arrange the three
notes on the ``circle of thirds'' below. The pitch classes of a triad will
always sit next to each other.

Triads are identified according to their \emph{root} and \emph{quality}.

\hypertarget{triad-roots}{%
\subsection{Triad roots}\label{triad-roots}}

To find a triad's root, arrange the pitch classes on a circle of thirds
(mentally or on paper). The root is the \emph{lowest} in the three-pitch-class
clump. Expressed another way, if the circle \emph{ascends} by thirds as it
moves clockwise, the root is the ``earliest'' note (thinking like a literal
clock), and the other pitch classes come ``later.''

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/triadsSeventhChords/circleOfThirds-triadRTF.svg}
\caption{A triad (A, C, E) on the diatonic circle of thirds.}
\end{figure}

Once you know the root, you can identify the remaining notes as the
\emph{third} of the chord (a third above the root) and the \emph{fifth} of the
chord (a fifth above the root).

\hypertarget{triad-qualities-1}{%
\subsection{Triad qualities}\label{triad-qualities-1}}

To find a triad's quality, identify the interval between the root and the
other members of the chord. There are four qualities of triads that appear in
major and minor scales, each with their own characteristic intervals.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  major triad: M3 and P5 above the root (as in \emph{do--mi--sol})
\item
  minor triad: m3 and P5 above the root (as in \emph{do--me--sol} or
  \emph{la--do--mi})
\item
  diminished triad: m3 and d5 above the root (as in \emph{ti--re--fa})
\item
  augmented triad: M3 and A5 above the root (as in \emph{me--sol--ti})
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/triadsSeventhChords/triads.png}
\caption{Four qualities of triads.}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{building-a-triad}{%
\subsection{Building a triad}\label{building-a-triad}}

To build a triad on the staff, identify the root, quality, and bass note from
the lead-sheet symbol. The root and quality will tell you what three pitch
classes belong to the triad. For example, \textbf{C+} tells you the root is C,
and the quality is augmented. Since the quality is augmented, there is a major
third above the root (E) and an augmented fifth above the root (G-sharp).
Since there is no bass note appended to the lead-sheet symbol, the bass note
is the same as the root: C. Write a C on the staff (in any comfortable
register), then write the other chord tones (E and G-sharp) \emph{above} the C
(see the Caug triad in the above figure).

For \textbf{Cm/E♭}, the root is C, and the quality is minor. Since the quality
is minor, there is a minor third above the root (E-flat) and a perfect fifth
above the root (G). The slash identifies E-flat as the bass note. Write the
E-flat on the staff. Then write a C and a G above it to complete the chord
(again, see above).

When all the members of the triad are as close to the bass note as they can
be, the chord is in what is called \emph{close position} (C, Cm/E♭, and
Cdim/G♭ above). When there are spaces between chord tones, the chord is in
\emph{open position} (Caug above). (In certain musical situations, only one of
those positions will be useful or desirable.)

\hypertarget{listening-to-triads}{%
\subsection{Listening to triads}\label{listening-to-triads}}

Each triad quality has its own distinct sound, and to an extent that sound is
preserved even when the chord is \emph{inverted} (when the pitch classes are
arranged so that a pitch class other than the root is in the lowest voice). As
you practice identifying and writing triads, be sure to play the triads, both
to check your analysis/writing and to develop the ability to identify chord
qualities quickly by ear.

\hypertarget{inversions}{%
\subsection{Inversions}\label{inversions}}

Both bass lines and root progressions are important for the study and mastery
of tonal harmony. Most of our work will focus on the bass lines, and what
follows will help you analyze the root progressions present in any figured
bass line. In other words, this will help you perform a Roman numeral analysis
of a figured bass line.

Note that on the charts below, generic capital Roman numerals are provided.

\hypertarget{chords-of-the-fifth}{%
\subsection{Chords of the fifth}\label{chords-of-the-fifth}}

In any chord of the fifth (``root position'': 5/3 or 7/5/3 chord), the bass
note and the root of the chord are the same. The Roman numeral to be assigned
to any chord of the fifth, then, is the scale degree of its bass note. If
\emph{do} is in the bass, the bass is scale-degree 1, and the Roman numeral is
\textbf{I}. If \emph{re} is in the bass, the Roman numeral is \textbf{II}. And
so on.

Chords of the sixth that take the figures 6/3 or 6/5/3 are
\emph{first-inversion} chords. They are so named because the third of the
chord (the next chord member above the root) is in the lowest voice. However,
thinking about inversions while performing an analysis can be cumbersome. It
is often simpler to remember that if the figure is 6/3 or 6/5/3 (or an
abbreviation such as 6 or 6/5), \emph{the root of the chord is the sixth above
the bass}. If \emph{mi} is in the bass, and the figure is ``6,'' the root is
\emph{do}, and the Roman numeral is \textbf{I}. If \emph{fa} is in the bass
and the figure is ``6/5,'' the root is \emph{re}, and the Roman numeral is
\textbf{II}. And so on.

Chords of the sixth that take the figures 6/4 or 6/4/3 (or an abbreviation
such as 4/3) are \emph{second-inversion} chords. They are so named because the
fifth of the chord (the second member of the chord above the root) is in the
lowest voice. Again, it is often simpler to remember that for 6/4, 6/4/3, and
4/3 chords, \emph{the root is the fourth above the bass}. If \emph{re} is in
the bass, and the figure is 4/3, the root is \emph{sol}, and the Roman numeral
is \textbf{V}.

Chords of the sixth that take the figure 6/4/2 (or its abbreviation 4/2 or
simply 2) are \emph{third-inversion} chords. Their root is a second, or a
step, above the bass. The most common 4/2 chord has \emph{fa} in the bass, and
\emph{sol} is its root, making its Roman numeral \textbf{V}.

Asymmetric and irregular meters mean the same thing, but calling them
``irregular'' might make them easier to understand from the drop. An
asymmetric/irregular meter is any meter where the beats have varying lengths,
seen clearly in the first example where we proceed through 5/8, 7/8, and 8/8.

In ths first ex with the different x/8s, we can even do different groupings
within these three time signatures.

\textbf{Do we still use notation from regular meters when we're in an
irregular meter?} (simple meters tell length of beat, compound meters tell
length of division) - Irregular meters use the same rules as compound meters.
This is because the division is the same in meters like 5/8 but the beats, by
definition, are not the same

\textbf{Mixed meter} - Mixing meters within the same piece!

\textbf{Polymeter} - More than one meter happening at the same time. While
mixed meter has everybody switching b/w meters together, polymeter has two or
more groups playing in different meters simultaneously.

\textbf{Implied polymeter} - What it says on the tin: the polymeter is not
explicitly written in time signatures, but the way the music itself is written
implies that it's happening anyway

\textbf{Polyrhythm} - Unlike polymeter, which happens at the bar level,
polyrhythm is the same concept happening at the beat level

\chapter{Class discussion}\label{class-discussion-14}}

\textbf{What do we mean by ``advanced modulatory techniques?''} - Things are
going to get wayyy more flexible! And therefore they're gonna get really weird
- Modulations to very distant keys are possible - Techniques like pivot chords
are going to get bizarre in what chords are actually involved, but the
baseline rules will stay the same: pivot chords happen in the middle of a
phrase, direct/phrase modulations happen between phrases

\textbf{Modulation \#1} - This ex is weird because where we hear the
modulation is really ambiguous, and you can make an argument for modulating on
the bVI or the bII in the second phrase - This and \#2 are examples of mode
mixture pivot chords! In this technique, we pivot on a borrowed chord. Just
like a regular pivot modulation, these generally happen in the middle of a
phrase because you need a functional progression on both sides

\textbf{Modulation \#3} - Where does this modulation actually happen? Is it a
pivot or a phrase modulation? - Pivot modulation. Remember that there's a
difference b/w a deceptive \emph{cadence} and a deceptive \emph{progression}.
We can't do a direct modulation after a deceptive progression because there's
no cadence--the phrase hasn't ended. - We modulate on the vii07 in the seventh
measure! It's just a respelling of the vii04/2 in the second measure. This is
called an \emph{enharmonic modulation}: by respelling the chord, it takes on a
function in the new key. In this case, we've pivoting on the respelled vii07 -
When writing the pivot, the chord will be spelled in one of the two keys. This
means you have to figure out what the inversion would be in the other key. For
this example, you would write vii04/2 in the top half of the bracket, and
vii07 in the bottom half of the new key. Seeing both chords are vii07, we will
know that you are saying the chords are enharmonically equivalent and that you
correctly ID'd the technique - You can also modulate using a secondary vii07 -
Common respelled chords: augmented triads (used as V chords) and Fr+6
(respelled as the Fr+6 of the key a tritone away from the home key--sees VERY
little use because this isn't as flexible)

\textbf{Modulations \#5 and \#6} - Another enharmonic modulation, this time
respelling a V as a Ger+6 in the new key by respelling the seventh. In this
example, a G7 is respelled as a Ger+6 in the key of B major just by respelling
the F as an E\# - In example 5, the Ger+6 has a predominant function. It comes
right before I6/4 - V, which are lumped together and have a dominant function
- When writing out the pivot bracket where the Ger+6 is in the home key, like
in example 6, we would label the chord Ger+6 in the top bracket \emph{even
though} it has been respelled. By putting Ger+6 in the top half of the bracket
and V7 in the bottom half, we actually inform whoever is looking at our
analysis that we understand it has been respelled - The progression must be
functional on both sides for a pivot modulation, but that's especially true
for these weird modulations that pivot on a chord with different functions in
each key. For example, in example 6 the Ger+6 has a predominant function, but
when it is respelled as a V7 it has a dominant function

\hypertarget{class-discussion-15}{%
\chapter{Class discussion}\label{class-discussion-15}}

\textbf{Augmented sixth chords} - Not based in tertian harmony, so their
``Roman numerals'' are written differently than normal - They're called
augmented sixth chords because they contain an augmented sixth - The primary
reason for these is voice leading--the raised tone moves up, the lowered tone
moves down. Both tones will proceed to the root of the next chord - a default
+6 chord will proceed to V and has \textbf{predominant function}

\textbf{Think of the components of these chords using scale degrees!} -
Italian (It): b6, \#4, 1 (x2) - German (Ger): b6, \#4, 1, b3 - French (Fr):
b6, \#4, 1, 2 - Ger+6 and Fr+6 are just It+6s with extra stuff!

Italian is the ``basic'' flavor: it just contains all the notes that all the
+6 chords have. In my experience, I actually had more trouble IDing It+6
chords than the other two because I psyched myself out looking for a fourth
tone that obviously was not there. So, be aware that It+6s are going ot have a
different shape than Ger+6 and Fr+6.

Speaking of shape, Ger+6s will usually appear in the same shape as a V6/5,
while Fr+6 will usually appear in the same shape as a V4/3. The default shape
for a It+6 is like a V6. (V(7) is used as a filler for simplicity: remember
that these all have predominant function.ex: Ab C Eb F\# can be renamed as Ab
C Eb Gb to make a Ab7 chord instead of Aug6 chord)

The ``inversion'' doesn't affect how we label these. No matter which note is
in the bass, it's always written as the default (x)+6. This is because the
chord is \emph{not} made up of stacked thirds, so our inversion labeling
system doesn't translate properly.

Common fix for Ger+6 resolution: have it go to a I6/4! Also be aware that
composers may enharmonically write any of the tones for voice leading purposes
(again, the primary use of these chords is just cool-sounding voice leading)

\textbf{Augmented sixth chords resolving to a non-dominant harmony} - By
writing some notes enharmonically, we can basically sub in one dominant chord
for another. In the example we did in class (in C), the respelled Ger+6
translated to a Db7, which still moved nicely over to V7. - Process: writing
out the full chord (Db F Ab B) and respelling the B as a Cb. Cb wants to
resolve down to the B in the next chord, and the F carries through to be the
seventh. - If you keep the chord as written, we have our normal +6 chord
function: the actual +6 resolves outward to the root of the next chord. So our
original +6 chord from the example resolves to a C major chord. - Labeling:
instead of using our ``in the key of'' secondary dominant labeling, the slash
indicates ``going to'' and you write the scale degree below the slash. The
Ger+6 in this example would be written as Ger+6/\^{}1 (remember the caret
should be written above the number) - In this instance, Ger+6/\^{}1 actually
has \emph{dominant} function, rather than predominant. It subs in for V7 and
proceeds straight to I. Think of respelling the chord as a Db7! Ger+6s can
have dominant function\ldots but only sometimes

\textbf{This was a lot of info, so here's the most important things to
remember:} - Tones of each kind of +6 chord - How the different tones resolve
- Function(s) of a +6 chord

\hypertarget{class-discussion-16}{%
\chapter{Class discussion}\label{class-discussion-16}}

\textbf{Key signature vs.~key} - You don't have to change key signatures to
modulate. Think of a piece in sonata-allegro form: it will rapidly modulate
during the development, but we don't get a key signature change for each one.
- Tonic defines key. Key signatures are shorthand for the benefit of the
performer, they have nothing to do with the actual key

\textbf{Key relationships} - Each key has five closely related keys: the key
with one more sharp, the key with one more flat, and the relative minor keys
of all three. - Ex: the closely related keys to C major are F and G major + A,
D, and E minor. The minor keys are relative to the major keys, which include C
major and the keys one sharp and one flat in either direction.

\textbf{Tonicization vs.~modulation: How do we tell the difference?} -
Signaling is the same for both: look for accidentals, namely raised notes (ti
in the temporary/new key, fi in the current key) - Placement: is the new key
area happening at the end of a phrase or is it in the middle? Furthmore, what
is \emph{around} it? If we stay in the new key, we've modulated, but if it's
temporary it's tonicization. - In the second example we listened to in class,
we have a V/VI - VI progression to the first fermata. However, the chords
after it are still in the key of I. This indicates that we haven't changed
keys. If we had, the following chords wouldn't make as much sense in I because
they're actually in the key of VI - Ear training is vital. We talked about it
a lot in class, but being able to follow \emph{do} as it moves between keys
will speed up the process of figuring out whether we're tonicizing or
modulating - Be aware that the actual \emph{look} of the music can be
deceiving. In the Chopin example we went over in class, he starts tonicizing
Bb major. Since the example is in G minor, Bb major's relative minor, putting
in a V/III requires no accidentals. Hunting for accidentals is a good start
for finding secondary dominants and/or modulations, but as with most theory
things\ldots it doesn't always work

If it establishes the new key it's a modulation. However, this requires
multiple things: you have to have a cadence, and you have to stay in the new
key. ``Does the phrase feel solid and stable in a new key?'' is a really
subjective question, though, which is how arguments/debate arise.

How do we know if a note is a non-chord tone?

Rhythms and placement in the bar. If the notes are on the downbeat or repeated
many times, it is likely a chord tone.

Do the notes fit if we stack thirds?

Function!

Look for non-chord tone patterns and how they move. Think neighbor tones or
suspensions etc.

\hypertarget{extended-tertian-harmony-and-non-chord-tones}{%
\section{Extended Tertian Harmony and Non-chord
tones}\label{extended-tertian-harmony-and-non-chord-tones}}

Extended harmony is anything beyond the seventh in a triadic chord. This
includes 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths. Labeled G9, G11, and G13 (for dominant
chords). - G9 is G,B,D,F,A - G11 is G,B,D,F,A,C - G13 is G,B,D,F,A,C,E

If a non-chord tone doesn't fit within our given possibilities, it's most
likely an extension. Your options for non-chord tones are: - passing tone -
neighbor tone - escape tone - appogiatura - suspension - retardation - pedal
tone (pedal point) - anticipation

If you have what looks like a G7, and you see an A, but it doesn't fit into
any of these non-chord tone motion options, you have a G9.

\hypertarget{dominant-ninth-chords}{%
\subsection{Dominant Ninth Chords}\label{dominant-ninth-chords}}

What are the differences between these chords? 1. V9 - when you have just a 9
next to the V, it includes all the triadic tones up to the ninth. - in C,
spelled G,B,D,F,A. 2. Vadd9 - ``add'' means to add a note to the triadic
harmony, in this case, you're adding the 9th. - in C, spelled G,B,D,A. - also
often grouped like G,A,B,D. - this is not the same as sub. - sub means to
substitute a chord tone with the given note. 3. V9 65 - still spelled like a
V9 but in first inversion (of seventh chord inversions). - if the ninth is on
the bottom, it's probably not a ninth, but a pedal tone. 4. Vsub13 - sub
effects a chord tone, while add doesn't. - though spelled the same as a iii6,
it functions as the dominant so it is labelled Vsub13 (or Vsub6). - in C,
spelled G,B,E.

A V9 chord is the combination of a V7 and a G\#\%7. In A, the lower 4 notes
are E,G\#,B,D (V7). The upper 4 notes are G\#,B,D,F\#. - when spelling
dominant extentions use the diatonic scale degrees in the key of the tonic.

\textbf{ALL OF THIS BEING SAID,} the ninth chord is a last resort. It is rare
in the type of music that this system of tonal analysis was created to
analyze. Extentions are used mainly for jazz, which is far out of our fixed
system of analysis.

Whether you analyze a tone as an extention or non-chord tone is up to how you
hear it. Just make sure you label the tone to match what your analysis says.

In the case of a b9, (in A minor) the chord symbol would be a E7(b9). In the
roman numeral analysis you would write V9, because the b9 is naturally
occuring in the key. It is altered in the parallel major (how we label
dominant extentions) so it is labelled as E7(b9) in chord symbols.

\hypertarget{class-discussion-18}{%
\chapter{Class discussion}\label{class-discussion-18}}

Mode mixture, modal interchange, and borrowed harmony all = the same thing

Mode mixture is just borrowing chords from parallel modes. Remember that
parallel modes all share the same tonic. For example, we'll be dealing with
all C scales, not every no-accidentals scale

V and vii0 are technically borrowed from the major key, we just use them in
minor because it sounds pretty (stronger resolutions and actual dominant
function)

\textbf{Variations between parallel major and minor} - Notice the voice
leading is the \emph{same}! This is why we say major and minor aren't really
different keys at all: their function is exactly the same. Be thinking about
voice leading and harmony rather than the actual notes

\textbf{Borrowing chords from the parallel minor (in C)} - What do we have to
do to alter ii to ii0? - Change the A in the tenor to an Ab. This is
\emph{le}, which makes our tenor line stronger because le has a stronger
resolution down to sol than la (half step rather than whole step) - What do we
have to do to alter vi to VI? - Alter the E in the alto to an Eb, and the A's
in the tenor and bass to Ab's. - \emph{Do not} raise the C in the soprano to a
C\#. While that would create an A major chord, what we actually want is an Ab
major chord because that's what is diatonic to C minor, the mode we're
borrowing from. - When we're borrowing chords, if the root is altered you need
to indicate it by putting an accidental in front. For example, the altered vi
we went over in class would be written as bVI\ldots very nicely eliminating
the confusion of what chord it's actually supposed to be. The A major chord
would actually be a V/ii. - We did a Picardy third. This is when everything is
in minor but you end on the major I.

\textbf{More borrowing from the parallel minor} - vii\%7 to vii07: pretty
standard, stronger resolution because we have le instead of la - vii\%7 to
bVII7: weird to hear because we're so used to ti -\textgreater{} do
resolutions, so have te instead sounds ``wrong'' - V7 to v7: ``this one just
sucks, right?'' - We need ti in order to have dominant function! Ti is your
best friend who makes things actually sound nice - If you're going to do mode
mixture, be sure to be consistent with altered tones. If you used both V7 and
bVII, it will sound like you couldn't make up your mind. Either use ti both
times or te both times - IV6 to iv6: sounds cool, but funky because the
bassline has an A2 in it. Funnily enough it goes really well with a bVII
though - vi to bVI: IT SOUNDS GOOD! Cannot go wrong with The Batman Chord,
especially as part of a deceptive cadence. Sounds epic

\textbf{Note:} this last bit was an exercise in messing around and hearing
different colors, not a model for how you should do assignments. Some of these
swaps just sound really, really bad and/or are a nightmare to deal with.

\emph{Le} and \emph{me} are going to be your most borrowed tones, though
\emph{le} is more common.

\hypertarget{class-discussion-19}{%
\chapter{Class discussion}\label{class-discussion-19}}

\textbf{Refresher: what is a pitch class (pc)?} - A number to represent all
enharmonic equivalents of a pitch. We use 0 to e - Remember 10 and 11 are
represented as t and e

\textbf{Refresher: what is a pitch class set (pcs)?} - A collection of pitch
classes. Each group size has a different name (refer to the chart in 22b)

\textbf{Notating pitch class sets} - Many of the examples on your homework
will be \emph{unordered} pitch class sets. Despite this name, we need a
standard system for writing these so we can easily make them \emph{ordered}
later. - Undordered pc sets are notated with parantheses around the set and
commas between each pc. Examples: (0,1,5,t) and (Bb,C,D,G). Like two points on
a graph are notated before you actually graph them.

\textbf{Modulo 12 arithmetic} - 12 is the magic number in this system!
Everything is based around 12. Just like how you know that the clock resets
when you go from noon to 1 P.M., the number above e/11 in this notation roll
back around to 0, 1, 2, etc. - If you have a number above 12, you subtract 12
from it to get the number that's actually within the bounds of our system.

\textbf{Notating transposition} - We are solely in fixed zero now. - We have
the pitch class set (E,F,G,Bb). Using traditional transposition methods,
transpose up a P4 to get (A,Bb,C,Eb) - If we convert our first pcs to integer
notation, we get (4,5,7,t). Add 5 to each number (subtracting 12 from any
numbers over e), and we have (9,t,0,3). Convert the second set back to note
names, and you will find it's the same as the second set the first time we
transposed in our traditional method. - The numbers in integer notation
represent intervals from 0. 5 = P4 because F is a P4 (5 half steps) from C (0)
- You would notate this process like this: T5(E,F,G,Bb) = (A,Bb,C,Eb) OR
T5(4,5,7,t) = (9,t,0,3). T5 just means that we are transposing by adding 5,
and it is fixed to the front of the original set to show that it is the one
we're manipulating.

\textbf{Transposing downward} - Same process as above, but instead of adding
numbers we subtract them! - In Mod12, you can also add 12 to a negative number
to get a pc within the bounds of our notation system.

\textbf{Normal form/normal order} - Normal form/order is an ascending
arrangement of a pcs where the outside interval is smallest. This is very
different from tertian harmony, where we're concerned with stacking in thirds.
- Let's use (1,7,t). Think about this process like using a clock face: you can
only go clockwise, which means you can shuffle which nubmer is first in the
set as long as the set remains in the same order. You can have (7,t,1) but you
can't have (1,t,7) because t is out of ascending order. - We can have
(1,7,t,), (7,t,1), or (t,1,7). We're looking for the smallest outside
interval, which we do by subtracting the last integer from the first one in
the set. t-1=9, 1-7=6, and 7-t=9. Since the middle one has the smallest
interval, the normal form for (1,7,t) is {[}7,t,1{]}. - Square brackets and
commas denote normal form. - \emph{Always} put things in ascending form before
you put them in normal or prime form. This form allows us to go through the
process of finding the smallest outside interval, so it's important that we
start out using it.

\textbf{Breaking ties for ordering pitch class sets} - What do we do if we do
all our subtracting and end up with two of the same result?? - Go one more
number in from the right with the remaining possibilities to break the tie!
Obviously there was no tie to break with (1,7,t), but if we wanted to break
the tie between the two 9 answers we would go 7-1=6 and 1-t=3 respectively.

\textbf{Developing a method for normal form using (3,e,5,2,8)} - Put in
ascending order: (2,3,5,8,e). Any ascending order is fine, but I usually start
with the smallest number on the left because it makes sure I don't get mixed
up - Get all our different ascending forms: - (2,3,5,8,e) - (3,5,8,e,2) -
(5,8,e,2,3) - (8,e,2,3,5) - (e,2,3,5,8) - Subtract the outside numbers (last
number - first number): - e-2=9 - 2-3=e - 3-5=t - 5-8=9 - 8-e=9 - Subtract the
next smallest intervals for the tiebreakers (second to last number - first
number): - 8-2=6 - 3-8=7 - 5-e=6 - Subtract the next smallest intervals for
the second tiebreakers (third to last number - first number): - 5-2=3 - 3-e=4
-The normal form for this pentachord is {[}2,3,5,8,e{]}. Remember that we're
subtracting the same number every time--we're just changing what we're
subtracting it \emph{from}

Completely symmetrical pitch class sets don't have a normal form, so we would
just write it in ascending form with the smallest number at the bottom.

\hypertarget{transposition-1}{%
\subsection{Transposition}\label{transposition-1}}

In post-tonal music, transposition is often associated with motion: Take a
chord, motive, melody, and when it is transposed, the aural effect is of
\emph{moving} that chord, motive, or melody in some direction. That's the
effect here, in two disconnected passages from Debussy's, \emph{La cathédrale
engloutie}:

\href{/images/postTonal/transposition.png}{\includegraphics{/images/postTonal/transposition.png}}

The opening motive --- comprising the notes B, D, E, or \{11, 2, 4\} --- is
transposed four semitones higher in m. 18, representing the cathedral's slow
ascent above the water. Transposing something preserves its intervallic
content, and not only that, it preserves the specific arrangement of that
thing's intervals. When we hear the passage at m. 18 above, we recognize its
relationship to the passage in m. 1 because the same intervals return, but
starting on a different pitch.

Transposition is an operation --- something that is \emph{done} to a pitch,
pitch class, or collection of these things --- or alternatively a
\emph{measurement} --- representing the distance between things. We represent
it as \emph{Tn}, where \emph{n} represents the ordered pitch-class interval
between the two things. To transpose something by \emph{Tn}, add \emph{n} to
every element in that thing (mod 12). Given the collection of pitch classes in
m. 1 above and transposition by \emph{T4}:

\href{/images/postTonal/t4.png}{\includegraphics{/images/postTonal/t4.png}}

The result is the pitch classes in m. 18. \emph{T4} \{11, 2, 4\} = \{3, 6,
8\}.

Alternatively, to determine the transpositional relationship \emph{between}
two things, subtract the first thing from the second. If the numbers that
result are all the same, the two things are related by that \emph{Tn}.

\href{/images/postTonal/t4Measurement.png}{\includegraphics{/images/postTonal/t4Measurement.png}}

This is how I arrived at the \emph{T4} arrow label in the musical example
above, by ``subtracting'' the pitch class integers of m. 1 from the
pitch-class integers in m. 18.

\hypertarget{normal-form}{%
\subsection{Normal Form}\label{normal-form}}

Normal order (sometimes called normal form) has a lot in common with the
concept of triad ``root position.'' Among other things, root position is a
standard way to order the pitch-classes of triads and seventh chords so that
we can classify and compare them easily. Normal order does the same, but in a
more generalized way so as to apply to chords containing a variety of notes
and intervals.

Normal order is the most compressed way to write a given collection of pitch
classes. Often, you'll be able to determine normal order intuitively using a
keyboard or a clockface, but it's good to learn a process that will always
give you the correct answer.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Write as a collection of pitch classes (eliminating duplicates) in ascending
  order and within a single octave. There are many possible answers.
\item
  Duplicate the first pitch class at the end.
\item
  Find the largest ordered pitch-class interval between adjacent pitch
  classes.
\item
  Rewrite the collection beginning with the pitch class to the right of the
  largest interval and write your answer in square brackets.
\end{enumerate}

For example, given \{G-sharp4, A2, D-sharp3, A4\}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Write as a collection of pitch classes (eliminating duplicates) in
  ascending order and within a single octave.} \{8,9,3\}
\item
  \emph{Duplicate the first pitch class at the end.} \{8,9,3,8\}
\item
  \emph{Find the largest ordered pitch-class interval between adjacent pitch
  classes.} In this case, the largest interval is between ``9'' and ``3.''
\item
  \emph{Rewrite the collection beginning with the pitch class to the right of
  the largest interval and write your answer in square brackets.} {[}3,8,9{]}
\end{enumerate}

Occasionally you'll have a tie in step 3. In these cases, write the ordering
implied by each tie and calculate the interval from the first to the
penultimate pitch class. The ordering with the smallest interval is the normal
order.

\textbf{What is a collection?} - A collection is an organized group of
pitches. It's kind of a squares and rectangles situation. All scales are
collections, but not all collections are scales.

\textbf{What is a mode?} - Related to major scales, modes are based around the
various scales degrees of a major scale. For example, E Phrygian is the same
key signature as C major but starts on the third scale degree - If thinking in
terms of what is altered from the original key is more helpful, you can
instead think of E Phrygian as having a lowered 2, 3, 6, and 7. Each mode has
its own lowered (or raised) scale degrees

\hypertarget{seven-note-collections}{%
\section{Seven note collections}\label{seven-note-collections}}

\textbf{All our modes:} - Ionian (major) - Dorian: 2nd degree of major
scale/lowered 3 and 7 - Phrygian: 3rd degree of major scale/lowered 2, 3, 6,
and 7 - Lydian: 4th degree of major scale/raised 4 - Mixolydian: 5th degree of
major scale/lowered 7 - Aeolian (natural minor) - Locrian: 7th degree of major
scale/lowered 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 - Lydian Dominant: half Lydian, half
Mixolydian/raised 4, lowered 7. You can remember this scale's relation to
Mixolydian because of ``dominant''/V because Mixolydian is based around the
fifth scale degree

\textbf{Major pentatonic} - 1, 2, 3, 5, 6/do re mi sol la

\textbf{Minor pentatonic} - 1, b3, 4, 5, b7 - Related to the major pentatonic
scale in the same way that the regular major and minor scales are related:
minor pentatonic is just major pentatonic starting on la

\textbf{Hirajoshi pentatonic} - 1, 2, b3, 5, b6/do re me sol le - Major
pentatonic using minor notes

\hypertarget{six-note-collections}{%
\section{Six note collections}\label{six-note-collections}}

\textbf{Whole tone scale} - Every note is a whole step apart. There are only
two unique whole tone collections: C D E F\# G\# A\# and Db Eb F G A B. You
can start on any of the notes within these collections, but the cycle of the
two will be the same - There's no possible center to a whole tone scale
because there are six notes in it and they are all a whole step apart. This
gives it its characteristic off-kilter feeling - Whole tone scale don't have a
standard mode of notation but will always have a diminished third somewhere -
Another way to think of these is as two interlocking augmented triads. For
example, with the first whole tone collection (C D E F\# G\# A\#), it is made
up of the two augmented triads C E G\# and D F\# A\# - Pretty common in music
because composers like to do cool and fancy stuff with them

\textbf{3+1 and 1+3 Hexatonic} - Based on interval patterns. 3+1 trades off
between a minor third and a half step between each note, and 1+3 trades off
between a half step and a minor third between each note - The 3 actually means
three half steps, but it may be easier to think of it as a minor third instead
- These scales have 4 unique collections which you can look at in the textbook
because I don't want to write them all out here sorry - As an example, though,
each collection can be used for either scale. Starting on a note that is
followed by a half step, you start a 1+3 hexatonic scale. Starting on one
followed by a minor third, you start a 3+1 hexatonic scale - We always label
these scales in ascending form!! You might be asked to build a descending one
of these, so make sure the interval pattern is correct

\hypertarget{eight-note-collections}{%
\section{Eight note collections}\label{eight-note-collections}}

\textbf{Ocatonic (also called a diminished scale)} - Happen either half-whole
(HW) or whole-half (WH) - Start on one note and alternate between half and
whole steps (for a HW octatonic) or between whole and half steps (for a WH
octatonic) - 3 unique octatonic collections. Just like the hexatonic and whole
tone scales, you can start on any pitch within the collections to get a
different scale - Stravinsky likes these! They have the potential to sound
really spooky and weird

\section{\texorpdfstring{From \emph{Open Music
Theory}}{From Open Music Theory}}\label{from-open-music-theory-10}}

Folk, pop, classical, and modern composers often organize pitch materials
using scales other than major and minor. Some of these scales, like the
various diatonic \emph{modes} and the pentatonic collection, are relatively
familiar to most listeners. Others --- such as octatonic, whole-tone, and
acoustic collections/scales --- are more novel, and usually (but not always)
found in twentieth- and twenty-first-century compositions.

When characterizing many of these new musical resources, the word
``collection'' is often more appropriate than ``scale.'' A \emph{collection}
is a group of notes --- usually five or more. Imagine a collection as a source
from which a composer can draw musical material --- a kind of ``soup'' within
which pitch-classes float freely. Collections by themselves do not imply a
tonal center. But in a composition a composer may establish a tonal center by
privileging one note of the collection, which we then call a \emph{scale}.

\hypertarget{diatonic-collection-modes}{%
\subsection{Diatonic Collection (modes)}\label{diatonic-collection-modes}}

The \emph{diatonic collection} is any transposition of the 7 white keys on the
piano. Refer to these collections by the number of sharps and flats they
contain: the ``0-sharp'' collection, the ``1-sharp'' collection, and so on.
The ``2-flat'' collection, for example, contains the pitch classes \{F, G, A,
B-flat, C, D, E-flat\}.

When these collections gain a tonic note, they morph into scales, which by
tradition we name according to the ``modal'' system established in centuries
ago. (Note that while these modes share their names with the modes of the
Medieval Christian church, they function quite differently. The similarity is
principally one of name.)

One way to look at these ``modes'' is to think of the seven white keys of the
piano \{C, D, E, F, A, B\}. These notes, when starting on different pitches,
create the different modal scales. By taking each note of the seven-white-key
collection, and treating it as as the tonic, all seven modal scales can be
played. Ionian treats C as tonic, Dorian treats D as tonic, Phrygian treats E
as tonic, Lydian treats F as tonic, Mixolydian treats G as tonic, Aeolian
treats A as tonic, and Locrian treats B as tonic:

Ionian mode (major scale): \emph{do re mi fa sol la ti do}

Dorian mode: \emph{do re me fa sol la te do}

Phrygian mode: \emph{do ra me fa sol le te do}

Lydian mode: \emph{do re mi fi sol la ti do}

Mixolydian mode: \emph{do re mi fa sol la te do}

Aeolian mode (natural-minor scale): \emph{do re me fa sol le te do}

Locrian mode (uncommon outside jazz): \emph{do ra me fa se le te do}

Like the major and minor scales, these intervallic relationships can be
transposed to any tonic pitch.

\hypertarget{pentatonic-collection}{%
\subsection{Pentatonic Collection}\label{pentatonic-collection}}

\emph{Pentatonic collections} are five-note \emph{subsets} of the diatonic
collection. Here's a quick way to create a pentatonic collection: (1) List the
notes of a major scale. (2) Remove scale degress 4 and 7. (E.g., the
pentatonic collection \{C,D,E,G,A\} corresponds to scale degrees 1,2,3,5,6 of
the C major scale.)

Removing scale degrees 4 and 7 results in a collection with no half steps. As
a result of its ``halfsteplessness,'' any member of the collection easily
functions as a tonal center. For example, given the 0-sharp pentatonic
collection, there are five unique scales formed when each of the collection's
pitch classes become a tonic: C pentatonic (C,D,E,G,A), D pentatonic
(D,E,G,A,C), E pentatonic (E,G,A,C,D), and so on.

The black keys on the piano also form a pentatonic collection:

\hypertarget{whole-tone-collection}{%
\section{Whole Tone Collection}\label{whole-tone-collection}}

This is a group of notes generated entirely by whole tones: \{0,2,4,6,8,10\},
for example.

There are only two unique \emph{whole-tone} collections. WT0 contains pitch
classes \{0,2,4,6,8,10\}, while WT1 contains pitch classes \{1,3,5,7,9,11\}.
In other words, WT0 contains the pitch classes \{C, D, E, F-sharp, G-sharp,
B-flat\}, while WT1 contains pitch classes \{C-sharp, D-sharp, F, G, A, B\}.

\hypertarget{octatonic-collection}{%
\subsection{Octatonic Collection}\label{octatonic-collection}}

Called octatonic because it has eight pitch classes, the \emph{octatonic
collection} is full of compositional potential and has been used by many
composers to a variety of ends. An octatonic collection is easily generated by
alternating half steps and whole steps. Using pitch class numbers, one example
is \{0,1,3,4,6,7,9,10\}.

The interval content of this collection is very homogenous, and this
intervallic consistency leads to one of its most interesting properties. When
we transpose the above collection by 3---adding 3 to each of the integers in
the collection---\{0,1,3,4,6,7,9,10\} becomes \{3,4,6,7,9,10,0,1\}. Comparing
the two shows that these collections are exactly the same! In fact, you would
come up with the same collection if you transposed it by 6 or 9 as well.

Olivier Messiaen called such collections ``modes of limited transposition.''
(The whole-tone scale is also a mode of limited transposition.) And as a
result of the property, there are only three unique octatonic collections. We
name these arbitrarily as OCT(0,1), OCT(1,2), and OCT(2,3). The numbers to the
right of ``OCT'' are pitch classes within that scale. (E.g., the
\{0,1,3,4,6,7,9,10\} collection I discussed above is OCT(1,2).) We can also
call them C--C♯ octatonic, C♯--D octatonic, and D--E♭ octatonic.

\hypertarget{other-collections-and-scales}{%
\subsection{Other Collections and Scales}\label{other-collections-and-scales}}

There are many, many other collections and scales used by composers and
musicians in the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries. Messiaen, for example,
described five more
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_limited_transposition}{modes of
limited transposition}, and there are other smaller collections that have the
same property. \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_scale}{Acoustic
scales}, formed from the first seven unique partials of the overtone series,
are common in the music of Debussy, Bartok, and Crumb --- ocassionally as a
representation of nature. Jazz musicians have an entire set of scales used for
improvisation. Non-Western musics often have unique systems of scales and
collections, such as the rāgas used in Indian classical music.

More generally, any large set of pitch classes that form the basis for a
passage may function as a collection, even if it has no familiar name. Most
often, music theorists refer to these collections with pitch-class set
notation.

\hypertarget{periods}{%
\subsection{Periods}\label{periods}}

A period is one type of theme, like the \href{sentence.html}{sentence}, common
to the Classical style.

The period is generally eight measures long and contains two four-measure
phrases, called \emph{antecedent} and \emph{consequent}.

The period is characterized by balance and symmetry. Its antecedent phrase is
initiated by a basic idea that recurs at the beginning of the consequent
phrase. Unlike the sentence, which exhibits a single cadence, the period
contains \emph{two cadences}, a weak one to end the \emph{antecedent} and a
strong one to end the \emph{consequent}.

\hypertarget{antecedent-phrase-mm.-14}{%
\subsubsection{Antecedent phrase (mm. 1--4)}\label{antecedent-phrase-mm.-14}}

Unlike the sentence, which contains a basic idea followed by a repetition, the
two measure basic idea that begins the a period's antecedent is always
followed by a two-measure \emph{contrasting idea} (CI). That contrasting idea
supports a cadential progression that ends the antecedent with a weak cadence,
either a HC or an IAC.

Antecedent: Haydn, Piano Trio in C major, Hob. XV:27, III, mm. 1-4

Note the contrast created between the basic idea and contrasting idea. While
the BI ascends, outlining the tonic triad with leaps to each of its members,
the CI descends stepwise leading to a weak I:HC. The emphasis on tonic in the
melody of the BI is accompanied by a tonic prolongation in the harmony (a
variant of the \href{schemataOpensAndCloses.html}{\emph{Romanesca} schema}):

\begin{quote}
\textbf{I V6 VI III}\\
or\\
\textbf{T(1 D7p x6 3)}
\end{quote}

Supporting the CI is an expanded cadential progression:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{III IV V6/5/V V}\\
or\\
\textbf{T3 S(4 {[}+{]}) D5}
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{consequent-phrase-mm.-58}{%
\subsubsection{Consequent phrase (mm. 5--8)}\label{consequent-phrase-mm.-58}}

Consequent phrases always begin with a restatement of the BI, occasionally
varied, and end with a CI. A consequent phrase's CI often resembles the
antecedent's, but slightly altered to accommodate a stronger cadence. It is
also common for a consequent phrase's CI to be entirely new. While a sentence
can close with a number of cadence types, the period's consequent phrase
always ends with a PAC:

Antecedent + Consequent: Haydn, Piano Trio in C major, Hob. XV:27, III, mm.
1-8

In this example, the BI is restated exactly at the beginning of the
consequent. The concluding CI is a slight variation of the end of the
antecedent, altered here to create a PAC.

\section{More Secondary Dominant
Functions}\label{more-secondary-dominant-functions}}

Any chord can have secondary function, not just dominants and leading-tones.

The V/IV in C is a C major chord. The only reason to label a C chord as V/IV
is if the V is a V7. This makes a V7/IV, spelled CEGBb, or I7. BUT you will
NEVER see a I7. It's function is the dominant of F, or the IV, so we write it
as V7/IV. This is the same idea as the V/V being a II, but you will never
write it as a II because that's not how it functions.

\hypertarget{secondary-dominant-chords-for-functions-other-than-dominant}{%
\subsection{Secondary Dominant chords for functions other than
Dominant}\label{secondary-dominant-chords-for-functions-other-than-dominant}}

This can include: - V/vi - V/ii - V/I (don't write) - etc.

The chord guide chart has secondary function replacements for each chord.

Diatonic Harmony: iii - vi - ii - V - I

Chromatic Harmony: V/vi - V/ii - V/V - V/I - V/IV - these can all be 7th
chords as well - in that case, the V/IV only functions as a 7th chord - the
V/V is included as a pre-dominant function

When can we use a secondary dominant funtion? - to prepare for a modulation -
when there's a circle of fifth progression - \emph{where there are chords} -
the only chord you can't decorate is a diminished chord - every other chord
can be tonicized

The root movement is the same whether you use diatonic or chromatic harmony.

\hypertarget{example-in-ab}{%
\subsubsection{Example In Ab}\label{example-in-ab}}

Where can you insert a secondary dominant?

iii - vi - ii - V - I

Cm - Fm - Bbm - Eb - Ab - On the Fm chord iii - V/ii - ii - V - I

Cm - F - Bbm - Eb - Ab - chromatic harmonies like to move in half-step motion.
- flats resolve down - sharps resolve up

With the V/ii - ii (F - Bbm), the chordal third of the V/ii resloves to the
the root of the ii. If the secondary dominant is a seventh chord (V7/ii), the
chordal seventh resolves to the third of the ii chord. - this is because
half-step motion likes to resolve

Take the progression V7/V - V7 - I in C (D7 - G7 - C). The chordal third of
the D7 (F\#) resolves up to the root of the V7 (G). - this is F\# moving
upward in half-step motion

The chordal seventh of the D7 (C) resolves down to the third of the V7 (B). -
more half-step motion

\hypertarget{secondary-dominant-chords}{%
\section{Secondary Dominant Chords}\label{secondary-dominant-chords}}

\textbf{In a minor key, are i and iv diatonic or chromatic?} - They are
diatonic! They show up naturally in minor keys. If we were to have a iv in a
major key, that would be a chromatic chord. Any chord that is modified from
how it would appear naturally in the major or minor key is chromatic.

\textbf{A standard progression: I - vi - ii - V - I (in C)} - Remember: fa
does \emph{not} always go to mi. In this progression, if you have F and G in
the alto voice for ii and V, fa should go to sol. This is because in
circle-of-fifths progressions, thirds always resolve up to the root of the
next chord.

\textbf{Altering ii - V} - The mystery chords are V and I in G major. All we
did was alter the key signature for the second two chords. The key signature
is a stand-in for adding an accidental (raised third) to ii.

\textbf{Changing ii to a dominant chord} - In order to get the same effect we
got in the last example, we need to add an accidental. Raise the third in ii
to get\ldots a V/V! This is called \emph{tonicization}. - Tonicization =
extending harmony to treat any non-tonic chord as a tonic. Another way to
think of this is just us temporarily creating a tonic. Remember, V/V - V
movement is really just V - I in the key of V. - Slashes below the staff = ``x
\textbf{of} x.'' Slashes above the staff = ``x \textbf{over} x.'' It can be
confusing, but try not to mix them up! Remember that Roman numerals label
function, whereas chord symbols label the actual notes within a chord. -
Unlike tertiary function chords, secondary dominants \emph{replace} function,
rather than extend/embellish it. I6/4 is always paired with V because it
extends dominant function, but V/x is always paired with x because we are
temporarily going to x's key area. One way to remember this is that we are
temporarily phasing over to a \emph{secondary} key.

\textbf{Do not} tonicize ii0 in minor or vii0 ever. There is no diminished key
and trying to do this for our part writing in this class is a bad idea.
However, in analyses later in the semester you might see a composer do this
because the Romantic period was really crazy.

\textbf{Secondary dominant seventh chords (same progression as before, but
with ii7)} - This process is the same as for turning a regular ii into a V/V,
but we end up with a V7/V instead! - \emph{How do I tell what inversion a
secondary function chord is in?}: The inversion figures will always be
attached to the Roman numeral to the left of the slash, as seen with V7/V.
They go with the ``upper'' Roman numeral because the ``lower'' one is just a
shorthand for a key in relation to the key we are already in. - As we'll see
in coming lectures, this process can used to tonicize any major or minor
triad.

\textbf{How do we determine V/V in different keys?} - Literally ask ``what is
the V of V'' and go from there - Relate V/V to something you're already very
familiar with: ii! In a way, V/V is really just a fancy ii. They share the
same root and usually share the same function. The only difference is V/V's
raised third - If thinking about solfege works better for you, you can use the
above point but think about sol and re instead. If you see re and fi together,
you'll know it's likely a V/V - These chords are weird and require added
accidentals so double-checking (or even triple-checking) them is always a good
idea!! Make sure what you ID'd matches up with what you wrote out in the
staff.

\textbf{Things to consider before you start part writing} - Harmonic Rhythm;
pitches could switch between being a chord tone and a NCT depending on the
harmonic rhythm - Chords/progression - Cadence - Key; Where are the important
notes? What notes are on the strong beats?

\textbf{Doubling} - No doubling thirds - The fifth can be omitted and the root
tripled, but you \emph{must} have the third to indicate the quality of the
chord. - Seventh chords - The fifth can also be omitted in a seventh chord,
but you have to have the root, third, and the seventh. - No doubling thirds or
sevenths (because the further you are into the overtone series, the worse it
will sound as they are tendency tones). You will also have to resolve those
tones and if they resolve the same way, those voices are now locked
together/pattern.

\textbf{Spacing} (SATB = Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass) - SAT need to be within
an octave of their adjacent voices. There can be more than an octave between S
and T, but not S and A or A and T - Closed position: less than an octave
between S and T. Open position: more than an octave between S and T - B can be
as far away or as close to T as you want. It doesn't matter, but it sounds
nice when you have bigger intervals on the bottom.

\textbf{Range} - ``A little above the staff to a little below the staff in all
the named clefs'' - S: middle C to G on top of the treble clef staff - A: G
below middle C to D in the treble clef staff - T: C3 to G above the bass clef
staff - B: E below the bass clef staff to D above the bass clef staff - S and
T ranges are the same, just an octave apart. The top of A and B ranges are an
octave apart. Be mindful that the bottom of A and B are \emph{not} an octave
apart.

\textbf{Voice crossing} - Voice crossing is when one voice moves to be above
or below another. - Don't do it. Never ever. Do not do voice crossing ever.

\hypertarget{chord-voicing}{%
\subsection{Chord voicing}\label{chord-voicing}}

In strict keyboard-style writing, there are four voices: the bass line (which
is usually a given in \emph{basso continuo} style), and three \emph{upper
voices}: the \emph{melody} or \emph{soprano}, the \emph{alto}, and the
\emph{tenor} (from highest to lowest). Since all three upper voices must be
played by a single hand, they should never span more than an octave.

The melody always has an upward-pointing stem. Alto and tenor share a
downward-pointing stem. If the alto and tenor share a note, that note receives
a single downward-pointing stem. (See m. 1 of the example below.) If melody
and alto share a note, that notehead is double-stemmed. (See m. 4 of the
example below.)

\href{images/BCModel.png}{\includegraphics{images/BCModel.png}}

When choosing the notes to place in the upper voices above a figured bass, use
the bass and figures to determine the pitch classes present in the chord.
(When realizing an \emph{unfigured bass}, you must determine appropriate
figures before realizing.) If the chord is a four-note chord, use each chord
member once, including the bass (exceptions will be noted later). If a chord
has three pitch-classes (a triad, for instance), use each pitch-class once,
and ``double'' one of them according to the following principles:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the figure is 6/4, 5/3, or other chord of the fifth, double the bass
  pitch class.\\
\item
  If the figure is 6/3 and the bass is a \emph{fixed scale degree} (\emph{do},
  \emph{re}, \emph{fa}, or \emph{sol}), double the bass pitch class.\\
\item
  If the figure is 6/3 and the bass is a \emph{variable scale degree}
  (\emph{mi}/\emph{me}, \emph{la}/\emph{le}, or \emph{ti}/\emph{te}) or a
  chromatically altered pitch, double one of the upper voices at the octave or
  unison.\\
\item
  Generally, do not double a variable scale degree or a chromatically altered
  pitch.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{tendency-tones}{%
\subsection{Tendency tones}\label{tendency-tones}}

A \emph{tendency tone} is a pitch (class)---usually represented as a scale
degree---that tends to progress to some pitch classes more than others.
Sometimes this tendency is absolute within a style, but more often it is
context-dependent.

The most prominent tendency tones in Western tonal styles are \emph{ti} (not
\emph{te}) and \emph{le} (not \emph{la}).

Generally speaking, when \emph{ti} appears it tends to be followed by
\emph{do} in the same voice. In a harmonic context, this tendency is strongest
when \emph{ti} occurs in a dominant-functioning chord, and the ``resolution''
of that tendency comes upon change of function (to tonic or predominant).

Likewise, when \emph{le} appears, it tends to be followed by \emph{sol} in the
same voice. This tendency is less dependent on function.

Exceptions to these tendencies include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When \emph{ti} is in the middle of a stepwise descent
  (\emph{re}--\emph{do}--\emph{ti}--\emph{la}--\emph{sol}, for example), it
  can progress down by step. (Note that \emph{step inertia} here diminishes
  the effect of an ``unresolved'' tendency tone. Because there are two
  conflicting tendencies in play, in this case, either can be ``resolved''
  unproblematically.)\\
\item
  When \emph{ti} is in an inner voice, it can progress down to \emph{sol} if
  necessary to accomplish good voice-leading in the other voices and ensure
  complete chords. This is called a \emph{frustrated leading-tone}.\\
\item
  When \emph{ti} is a functional dissonance of a tonic-functioning chord (see
  below) it should progress down by step.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{functional-dissonances}{%
\subsection{Functional dissonances}\label{functional-dissonances}}

Some tendencies, such as the tendency for \emph{le} to progress down, are
relatively context-independent. Others are heavily contextualized. The primary
contextual tendency for how melodic notes progress is the concept of
\emph{functional dissonance}.

Keep in mind from the \href{harmonicFunctions.html}{Harmonic functions
resource} that chords tend to cluster in one of three functional groups
(\textbf{T}, \textbf{P}, or \textbf{D}) When pitches fuse into a chord
expressing one of these three functions, the pitches that comprise that have
certain tendencies of progression that they may or may not have in other
contexts.

Following are the scale degrees which act as dissonances for their respective
functions:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}rc@{}}
\toprule
function & dissonances \\
\midrule
\endhead
T or Tx & 7, 5 when 6 is also present \\
P & 3, 1 when 2 is also present \\
D & 4, 6 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

In purely diatonic music (triads and seventh chords, no chromatics), these
will include \emph{the seventh of every seventh chord}, \emph{the fifth of
viiº or VII} (\emph{fa}), and \emph{the fifth of III or iii} (\emph{ti/te}).

Keep in mind that only sometimes do these functional dissonances express
themselves in chords or intervals that are acoustically dissonant. However,
they do introduce a degree of tension that, like an acoustically dissonant
interval in species counterpoint, requires a smooth introduction and a
specific resolution.

When one of these scale degrees is present in a chord with the corresponding
function, the dissonant scale degree has a strong tendency to \emph{resolve
down by step over the next change in function}. In strict composition, we will
\emph{always} follow these tendencies.

In strict keyboard style, these functional dissonances should be ``prepared''
(approached) by common tone or by step. Thus, though they are proper members
of the chord, melodically they will look like one of the three dissonance
types of species counterpoint: a \emph{passing tone} or \emph{neighbor tone}
dissonance that is approached by step, or a \emph{suspension} dissonance that
is approached by a common tone. The suspension type is preferred.

Once a functional dissonance is introduced, it must be resolved down by step
in the same voice when the function changes. The dissonance can also be
\emph{transferred} to another voice before resolution---for instance, if there
are multiple chords in a row exhibiting the same function, a dissonance that
appears in the alto can be transferred to the tenor in the following chord,
and then resolve in the tenor when the function changes. (It is more typical,
and smoother sounding, to transfer dissonances between inner voices or from an
inner voice to an outer voice than from an outer voice to an inner voice. Once
a dissonance appears in the melody or bass, where it is more noticeable, it
tends to resolve in that voice.)

Functional dissonance resolutions often cause conflicts with other principles
of voice leading. Except in special cases such as \emph{schemata} (standard
patterns that are common enough to sound appropriate, even if they follow
different rules), the functional dissonance resolution takes precedence over
other principles such as the \emph{law of the shortest way}, contrary motion
with the bass, and preferring common tones and steps to melodic leaps. A
dissonance resolution is never an excuse for illegal parallels, and only
rarely will lead to non-standard doublings.

Seventh chords are most easily thought of as an extension of triads, and our
labeling system reflects this. In the same that we create a triad by stacking
two 3rds, we create a seventh chord by adding another 3rd on \emph{top} of a
triad. They are called seventh chords because this new pitch creates an
interval of a 7th between the chordal root and the new pitch.

Because they are stacked thirds, seventh chords are still considered tertian
harmony. They are prevalent in almost all styles of Western music, and we have
developed many systems to describe how they \emph{function} harmonically.
Again though, we must first be able to classify and label them in an
structural manner that does not rely on key-based functions. We name the chord
members by the distance above the bottom pitch \textbf{when the chord is
stacked in thirds}: - the lowest pitch is called the \emph{root} of the chord
- the pitch that is a 3rd above the root is called the \emph{chordal third} -
the pitch that is a 5th above the root is called the \emph{chordal fifth} -
the pitch that is a 7th above the root is called the \emph{chordal seventh}

\hypertarget{seventh-chord-inversions}{%
\subsection{Seventh chord inversions}\label{seventh-chord-inversions}}

All seventh chords have exactly four unique notes, although certain chord
members can occasionally be omitted (and therefore implied) depending on the
context. With four pitches, there are four possible configurations that depend
on which note of the triad is in the lowest voice. Like triads, we call these
\emph{inversions}, and we use the same shorthand system to label inversions
that we used with triads.

\hypertarget{goals-for-this-topic-5}{%

Using the examples below: - determine what role each chordal member
(e.g.~root, third, fifth, etc.) plays in determining the quality of a seventh
chord - How does this relate to triads? - find all six intervals between the
chordal members of a root-position seventh chord for each of the following
chord qualities: - \emph{major seventh, minor seventh, dominant seventh,
half-diminished, fully-diminished} - explain how we determine both words of
each of the alternate names for seventh chords - \emph{Major major} (MM),
\emph{major minor} (Mm), \emph{minor minor} (mm), \emph{diminished minor}
(dm), and \emph{diminished diminished} (dd) - find the following interval
sizes between chordal members of a seventh chord (Hint: This may involve
moving some chord members up or down an octave) - seconds (1) - thirds (3) -
fourths (2) - fifths (2) - sixths (3) - sevenths (1) - relate these intervals
to our system for labeling seventh-chord inversions - provide inversion
figures for root-position, first-inversion, second-inversion, and
third-inversion seventh chords - be able to explain how to turn any inverted
and/or open-voiced seventh chord into a root-position seventh chord in a
closed voicing

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-26}}

A seventh chord is a diatonic chord containing four pitches stacked in thirds.

There are 5 types of seventh chords, and we will be using both of the commonly
used terms for them: - \emph{Major major} (abbreviated \texttt{MM}) or
\emph{major seventh chord} - \emph{Major minor} (abbreviated \texttt{Mm}) or
\emph{dominant seventh chord} - \emph{Minor minor} (abbreviated \texttt{mm})
or \emph{minor seventh chord} - \emph{Diminished minor (abbreviated
\texttt{dm}) or }half-diminished seventh chord* - \emph{Diminished diminished}
(abbreviated \texttt{dd}) or \emph{fully-diminished seventh chord}

These terms are interchangeable but they are typically used in different
circles. We will refer to them as the pedagogical name (e.g.~major major,
etc.) and common name (e.g.~major seventh chord, etc.).

The pedagogical names are useful in illustrating the structure of a seventh
chord and is unsurprisingly often used by theory teachers. The first word
represents the quality of the base triad on which the seventh chord is built
(e.g.~major triad on bottom), and the second word describes the interval
between the root and the chordal seventh. This description explains the nature
of the pedagogical categorization--it mixes a chord quality with an interval
quality. The first word always describes the triad (the bottom three pitches)
while the second word describes the \emph{interval quality} between the root
and the seventh chordal member. This interval is always assumed to be a 7th.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Major major (major seventh chord): major triad + M7
\item
  Major minor (dominant seventh chord): major triad + m7
\item
  Minor minor (minor seventh chord): minor triad + m7
\item
  Diminished minor (half-diminished seventh chord): diminished triad + m7
\item
  Diminished diminished (fully-diminished seventh chord): diminished triad +
  d7
\end{itemize}

Building on your knowledge of inversion figures from triads, it should be
possible to derive the seventh chord system. Like triad inversions, they: -
use the intervals above the \emph{bass}, not the \emph{root} of the chord. -
are written in superscript next to your chord quality (or Roman numeral when
we get there). - have abbreviated versions that will be used rather than
writing out every interval

There are four possible inversions for seventh chords. Below, you will find
their abbreviated forms (most commonly used) and their full interval forms in
parentheses. Remember that when written by hand or in music notation software,
you will stack the numbers and \emph{not} include a slash between them. - Root
position: 7 (7/5/3) - First Inversion: 6/5 (6/5/3) - Second Inversion: 4/3
(6/4/3) - Third Inversion: 4/2 (6/4/2)

As a reminder, we will be using the term \emph{inversion figure} to discuss
this shorthand method of identifying inversions. Other systems refer to these
same superscript numbers as figured bass, bass position Symbols, or figures,
but we need not argue about which name is better. As long as the student
understands the difference between \emph{inversion figures}, true
\emph{figured bass} (i.e.~Baroque system for writing keyboard harmonies), and
the shorthand used in \emph{leadsheet notation}, it will make no difference in
your effectiveness.

Exercises in strict voice-leading, or species counterpoint, begin with a
single, well formed musical line called the \emph{cantus firmus} (fixed voice,
or fixed melody; pl. \emph{cantus firmi}). \emph{Cantus firmus} composition
gives us the opportunity to examine the following fundamental musical traits:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  smoothness\\
\item
  independence and integrity of melodic lines\\
\item
  variety\\
\item
  motion towards a goal
\end{itemize}

The ``rules'' of the style of counterpoint that we will study are compiled
from important writings and treatises of the eighteenth century, most notably
Johann Joseph Fux, so this style of counterpoint is typically referred to as
\emph{eighteenth century counterpoint}. As with all historical studies,
especially those that are spread across a continent over decades, there are
inconsistencies between systems and styles. We will look at a simplified
version of contrapuntal writing to focus our thoughts on melodic interaction,
however I urge you to complete a full study of counterpoint at some point in
your musical development in order to properly explore this critical facet of
music. Our discussion of this topic, however brief, aims to help you absorb
the methodology of good counterpoint (voice-leading).

\hypertarget{terms-useful-for-discussing-counterpoint}{%
\subsection{Terms useful for discussing
counterpoint}\label{terms-useful-for-discussing-counterpoint}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Melodic intervals - intervals within a line (horizontal intervals)
\item
  Harmonic intervals - intervals between lines (vertical intervals)
\end{itemize}

We will consider three types of melodic intervals: - Movement by a 2nd is
\emph{stepwise} motion - Movement by 3rd is a \emph{skip} and typically
implies a triad. - Any movement of a 4th or larger is called a \emph{leap} and
has the most restrictions.

We use the terms \emph{stepwise}, \emph{skip}, and \emph{leap} exclusively to
describe melodic intervals, because each of these terms imply forward motion.
Do not use these terms to describe harmonic intervals. For harmonic intervals,
we use the types of motion (e.g.~parallel, similar, etc.) combined with the
size of the intervals (e.g.~parallel 3rds, etc.)

\hypertarget{counterpoint-first-species}{%
\subsection{1:1 Counterpoint (first
species)}\label{counterpoint-first-species}}

In first species counterpoint, we begin with a \emph{cantus firmus} (new or
existing) and compose a single new line--called the \emph{counterpoint}--above
or below the cantus firmus. That new line contains one note for every note in
the cantus; both the cantus firmus and the counterpoint will consist of only
whole notes. Thus, first species is sometimes called one-against-one or 1:1
counterpoint.

\hypertarget{goals-for-this-topic-6}{%
\section{Goals for this topic}\label{goals-for-this-topic-6}}

Use the following examples of first-species (1:1) counterpoint to develop
guidelines for writing in this style. Each of the following examples is in the
major mode and has the counterpoint above the cantus firmus, but be aware that
not all counterpoint is written this way; it is common to have the cantus
firmus above the counterpoint or to compose in the minor mode. We are using a
simplified structure as an introduction to the concepts.

\textbf{As you develop your rules for first-species counterpoint, look only at
the \emph{counterpoint (CP)} line; the \emph{cantus firmus (CF)} was provided,
so the counterpoint line was written by following the stylistic rules, not the
cantus firmus.}

Generally, your rules should be divided into three categories: - Constructing
a \emph{melodic line} and \emph{melodic intervals} - Length - Starting and
ending pitches - Approaching the final note - Repeated pitches - Melodic
intervals - Leaps - Resolutions following leaps - Range - Climax (position in
melody and frequency) - Acceptable \emph{harmonic intervals} - Valid harmonic
intervals - Particularly starting and ending intervals - Approaching perfect
intervals - Approaching the final pitch - Number of times that an interval
size can be used consecutively - Differentiate between perfect and imperfect
consonances - Acceptable \emph{motion between lines} - Acceptable types of
motion

\textbf{Note that these examples are taken from a counterpoint random
generator and lack some of the elegance that human-composed counterpoint tends
to have.}

\hypertarget{conclusions-27}{%
\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-27}}

As you develop your counterpoint rules, your observations will naturally
separate into three categories mentioned above: - rules within a single melody
(the horizontal aspect of the music) - rules for comparing the intervals
between the two melodies (the vertical aspect of the music) - and rules for
studying the motion between the line.

To plut this simply, there are rules for melody, harmony, and voice-leading.

\hypertarget{melodic-intervals-and-structure}{%
\subsection{Melodic intervals and
structure}\label{melodic-intervals-and-structure}}

These are some general guidelines for each of the \emph{melodic} aspects of
1:1 counterpoint. - First species counterpoint typically has 8 to 14 pitches.
- As a general rule, use stepwise motion as much as possible. - Thirds or
other leaps can form triads, and this can create a non-functional implied
harmony. - The final note should be approached by stepwise contrary motion. -
Therefore one voice will have the seventh scale degree (\texttt{ti}) and the
other will have the second scale degree (\texttt{re}). - There are generally
no repeated pitches - Meaning that static and oblique motion do not occur in
first species because they both require at least one voice to repeat pitches -
The line should have a clear high (or low) point. - Repeating the highest
pitch--or lowest if the contour arcs downward--undermines the climax. A strong
melody will have a clear beginning, middle, and end, so having multiple
climaxes muddies this journey. - Leaps should be used sparingly, because too
many leaps imply certain types of harmony that were not common in this style.
- Leaps should always be aproached and left by step, preferably in contrary
motion. - You may sometimes leap to or from the climax.

\hypertarget{harmonic-intervals-and-structure}{%
\subsection{Harmonic intervals and
structure}\label{harmonic-intervals-and-structure}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  1:1 counterpoint will likely start and end on a perfect octave (or unison)
  of the tonic pitch, although a perfect fifth can be used to begin the
  counterpoint if necessary.
\item
  In this style of counterpoint, perfect intervals should only be approached
  by contrary or oblique motion, although oblique motion is not allowed in
  first species. (You can use oblique in the later species.)
\item
  You should only use consonant intervals in first species, which you can
  review from
  \href{\%7B\%7B\%20site.baseurl\%20\%7D\%7D\%20/05-counterpoint-embell-shapes/a2-introcounterpoint.html}{the
  previous topic}.
\end{itemize}

To be clear, this means that the acceptable consonant intervals in first
species are: - \textbf{Perfect}: Perfect fifths and octaves -
\textbf{Imperfect}: Major and minor thirds and sixths

\hypertarget{motion-between-lines-in-first-species}{%
\subsection{Motion Between Lines in First
Species}\label{motion-between-lines-in-first-species}}

Types of motion - contrary - no restrictions - parallel - some restrictions -
similar - some restrictions - static - not allowed - oblique - not allowed

In first species, an individual line cannot repeat a pitch, so this eliminates
both static and oblique motion entirely. Contrary motion is the easiest motion
to use because it has almost no restrictions. Parallel and similar motion are
less common but still regularly used; you will need to pay careful attention
to avoid creating part writing errors with both of these.

\hypertarget{errors-in-motion}{%
\subsection{Errors in motion}\label{errors-in-motion}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  parallel perfect octaves and perfect fifths

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Parallel perfect octaves and fifths are always unacceptable. Repeating the
    same pitch in this manner blurs the independence of the lines and becomes
    too similar to monophony.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  contrary perfect octaves and perfect fifths

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Unacceptable contrary octaves and fifths occur when two identical perfect
    intervals occur consecutively in contrary motion. This is a way of trying
    to hide parallel perfect octaves or fifths by using contrary motion.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  similar/direct/hidden octaves and fifths

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Unacceptable similar motion occurs when you approach a perfect fifth or
    octave in similar motion from any interval. Approaching a perfect interval
    by similar motion makes it more difficult to hear the interval and will
    make it difficult to continue writing your counterpoint without creating
    more errors. Similar octaves or fifths are also referred to as direct
    octaves/fifths or hidden octaves/fifths; I prefer the term ``similar
    octaves/fifths'' because it describes the motion accurately.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Today's topic is the second classification of regular meters: \emph{compound}
meters.

We will be using the terminology from the previous topic, so if you are
unfamiliar with basic rhythmic terminology, please review Topic 4a first.

And always remember that meter is somewhat subjective and can be greatly
altered by many factors, especially tempo. We will discuss this in the next
topic, but where one listener might listen to a piece with four quarter-notes
per measure and feel that the quarter notes are the beat, another listener may
listen to the same piece and hear the beat in a slow two with the half-note as
the beat.

was altered, and does it change your perception of whether the tune is simple

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-28}}

The common characteristic of compound meters is easy to find after having
discussed simple meters.

\emph{Compound meter is a \textbf{regular} meter in which the beat is divided
into three equal parts.}

Differentiating regular and irregular meters may be a new concept, but you
needn't worry about this too much right now because we will not be covering
irregular meters until later in the course. For now, know that the subjective
nature of meters will be discussed in the next topic, 4c - Metric Perception.
After that discussion, we will see if this concept makes more sense.

\hypertarget{describing-compound-time-signatures}{%
\subsection{Describing compound time
signatures}\label{describing-compound-time-signatures}}

For a \emph{compound} time signature: - the top number is how many divisions
are in the meter. - the bottom number is the rhythmic value of the division.

These definitions may take quite a few tries for you to reach on your own,
because students often focus on making compound time signatures fit the same
mold as simple time signatures. It is easy to be careless with your use of the
terms \emph{beat, division}, and \emph{subdivision}, but these three terms are
the keys to separating compound from simple meters and their time signatures.
In a simple meter time signature, the top number represents the number of
\emph{beats} in the measure, and the bottom number is the \emph{note value} of
the beat. Contrast that with compound meter time signatures. The top and
bottom numbers represent entirely different concepts, and for compound meters,
this requires a slight bit of math to find the actual number of beats. - To
find the number of beats in a compound time signature, divide the top number
by 3.

This highlights a fundamental issue in teaching our time signature system. It
requires the musician to already understand the system by being able to
differentiate between simple and compound meters, because the system is not
uniform across all meters. This is why the pedagogical method of grouping
meters by \emph{simple} vs \emph{compound} and then attaching a word to denote
the number of beats (i.e.~single, duple, triple, quadruple, etc.) is useful.

\hypertarget{duple-triple-and-quadruple-1}{%
\subsection{Duple, Triple, and
Quadruple:}\label{duple-triple-and-quadruple-1}}

The terms duple, triple, and quadruple refer to the number of beats in the
measure. In compound time: - duple has 2 strong beats with 3 eighth notes per
beat. - ex: 6/8 - triple has 3 strong beats with 3 eighth notes per beat. -
ex: 9/8 - quadruple has 4 strong beats with 3 eighth notes per beat. - ex:
12/8

Within a given meter classification, there are many different time signatures.
For example, in compound duple, there is 6/8, 6/16, 6/4, and many others.

\hypertarget{differentiating-between-compound-and-simple-meters}{%
\subsection{Differentiating between compound and simple
meters}\label{differentiating-between-compound-and-simple-meters}}

The simplest and most accurate method for differentiating the various meters
is to memorize the standard groupings of all meters. That being said it is
fairly easy to remember that if the top number of the time signature is a
multiple of three, then that is a compound meter, assuming that the tempo does
not become slow or fast enough that that the listener hears a different
grouping of the beat.

\hypertarget{theoretically-ideal-rhythmic-notation-in-compound-time}{%
\subsection{``Theoretically ideal'' rhythmic notation in compound
time}\label{theoretically-ideal-rhythmic-notation-in-compound-time}}

Like simple time, theoretically ideal rhythmic notation in compound time does
not obscure beats. Unlike simple time, compound time is written this way in
common practice with few exceptions.

The most notable exception, though, occurs regularly enough that we should
expect it. Occasionally a compound meter will create hemiola--a feel of two
against three--by having three consecutive groups of two divisions over two
compound beats. The most common notation of this occurs in 6/8 when three
quarter notes are placed in a row. If written using quarter notes rather than
tying two eighth notes together, this will obscure the second beat. The tune
``America'' from \emph{West Side Story} highlights this rhythm as its primary
melodic motif.

\hypertarget{beat-counting}{%
\subsection{Beat counting}\label{beat-counting}}

As with simple meters, there are various systems for counting beats and their
divisions. One of the most common systems condenses the method for counting
beats in simple time to 1-\&-a. The other most common counting method uses
1-la-li. For this course, we will use the -la-li method to help differentiate
the counting from a simple meter.

The problem with both of these systems is that there is not a unique syllable
for each subdivsion. Generally speaking, students are asked to insert ``ta''
between each of the division syllables creating 1-ta-la-ta-li-ta. This is
adequate for practice aloud, but it is poor for specificity because there are
three `ta' syllables in each beat. For our class, we use: 1-to-la-ta-li-ti

\hypertarget{meters-that-have-a-3-as-the-top-number-of-the-time-signature}{%
\section{Meters that have a `3' as the top number of the time
signature}\label{meters-that-have-a-3-as-the-top-number-of-the-time-signature}}

After listening the two examples in 3/4, it is easy to identify that the two
examples were identical except for the tempo. In the slower example, you will
likely hear it in a simple triple meter with the quarter note as the beat. For
the faster example, most instead hear this as a fast compound single meter
with the dotted half note as the beat. Meters such as 3/8, 3/4, and 3/2 are
all dependent on tempo as to whether they are a compound or simple meter.
While a good rule of thumb is to consider these meters as simple until you
have listened to the piece at tempo, 3/8 meters are commonly fast and
conducted in one. Make sure to look at the tempo if determining a meter's
classification when only looking at the score.

If we think back on our progression through the course thus far, we began by
studying individual pitches, then combined those pitches into intervals, and
then assembled those intervals sequentially and simultaneously to create
melodies and chords respectively. Next, we studied a simplified version of
counterpoint in order to examine how the combined vertical and horizontal
aspects of music interact to create basic tonality. While counterpoint
provides a framework for understanding harmony, it is primarily a study of how
the horizontal aspect of music, melody, combines and \emph{implies} harmony;
it does not establish the vertical aspect of music, harmony, as a standalone
concept.

Therefore, we can use a simple counterpoint exercise to begin determining how
harmony functions, because harmony is defined by the melodic tendencies of
certain pitches within a diatonic scale.

\textbf{Each measure of the next example implies the same two harmonies

note.} - Which two harmonies do you think these measures imply? - What are the
Roman numerals and inversion figures for each measure? - Is there more than
one option for any of the harmonies? - Are all the intervals consonant? - If
not, to which chords do the dissonant intervals belong?\\
- Do any particular chord members seem more important than the others? - Do
any of these measures sound ``weaker'' than the others?

\hypertarget{conclusion-8}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-8}}

All of the two-voice progressions in the example imply harmonies of V moving
to I in the key of C major, although you could make the argument that some of
the implied harmonies are actually viio instead of V7. The bass movement of
the first three measures highlights V moving to I, but even once the bass
movement changes, you should still hear the same progression of tension and
release.

From this, we may conclude that two voices--in this case a soprano line and a
bass line--are enough to imply tonality. Furthermore, we can observe that the
pitches within a V7 chord pull toward resolving to the pitches of the I chord.
One chord is stable and final, while the other wants to resolve to the stable
and final chord.

This is \emph{harmonic function}. A chord's function is a way of describing
how it works within the context of tonal music.

\hypertarget{harmonic-functions-in-diatonic-music}{%
\section{Harmonic functions in diatonic
music}\label{harmonic-functions-in-diatonic-music}}

In diatonic music, there are three basic categories of harmonic function:
\emph{tonic}, \emph{dominant}, and \emph{pre-dominant}. - \emph{Tonic}
(\textbf{T}) harmonies feel stable and final. - This is primarily the I chord,
but in some circumstances, this can include the vi chord. - \emph{Dominant}
(\textbf{D}) harmonies are strong but unstable. They have a strong tonal
gravity pulling toward a \emph{tonic} harmony - This includes the V and viio
chords. - \emph{Pre-dominant} (\textbf{P}) harmonies are weak and unstable.
Their tonal gravity pulls them toward \emph{dominant} harmonies. - This
includes the ii and IV chords, but can occasionally include the vi chord. -
Note that there is a difference between the words ``pre-dominant'' and
``predominant.''

\hypertarget{some-caveats-on-making-assumptions-based-on-this-exercise}{%
\subsection{Some caveats on making assumptions based on this
exercise}\label{some-caveats-on-making-assumptions-based-on-this-exercise}}

You may be tempted to make some definitive conclusions about voice-leading
from looking at these examples--such as \texttt{ti} resolving to \texttt{do},
or \texttt{fa} resolving to \texttt{mi}--but be careful not to over-generalize
with these ideas. If you make the assumption that \texttt{ti} always resolves
to \texttt{do} without considering the context, you will make errors in
situations where \texttt{ti} is not part of a dominant function. We will
explore the true nature of tendency tones and their resolution in the next
unit.

You may also notice that the chordal fifth is the least common chordal member
in these examples, and as we will see when we begin voicing four-part harmony,
the chordal fifth is indeed expendable. The root and third are best at
implying a harmony, and the chordal seventh adds a strong resolution, whereas
the fifth only provides a ``fullness'' to the chord. But not \emph{all}
chordal fifths are easily expendable, and sometimes composers will choose to
imply/omit a chordal third (or even root!) given a particularly context. We
will explore all of these ideas further in our part-writing studies.

\hypertarget{cadences-1}{%
\section{Cadences}\label{cadences-1}}

Because of the importance of the V-I progression, we will introduce an
important term in understanding harmony: the \emph{cadence}. We will explore
cadences further in the Unit 8, but for now, you may think of a cadence as a
harmonic progression used to conclude a musical phrase. There are many types
of cadences, but all of the progressions above are \emph{authentic
cadences}--cadences that have a V chord moving to a I chord. Bass movement is
a key factor in determining the strength of a cadence. For example, measures 1
and 3 in the examples likely sound stronger to you than the last measure. The
last measure not only lacks \texttt{sol} to \texttt{do} in the bass, it also
does not have a tonic in the final chord. We will return to this idea when
discussing cadences in detail in Unit 8a.

N/A yet

Neapolitan chord and augmented sixth chords act as functional substitutions
for pre-dominant chords, although we looked at how they could be used to
substitute for dominant chords as well. The chord that you will study below
does not fulfill one of the three primary functions; instead, it is used to
embellish and elongate a function.

It is possible to think of this chord using tertian harmony, but its
voice-leading determines its construction.

Listen to and then analyze the following three progressions. The first is the
most straightforward example of this chord, and each example gets
progressively more complicated. As always, start your analysis with leadsheet
symbols and then provide Roman numerals when possible. In each progression,
study the chromatic chord to answer the following questions: - How would you
describe its construction? - How does it function? (e.g.~tonic, passing, etc.)
- Does it have tendency tones, and if so, how do they resolve? - If you were
to compare it to a diatonic or chromatic chord that normally fulfills this
function, which chord shares the most commonalities with it? - Does this
embellishing chord work for all types of chords (i.e.~major, minor, etc.)? If
not, why?

\hypertarget{conclusions-29}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-29}}

Each of these three examples contains one chord which does not function like
any chord that we have studied thus far. - The first example is mostly
straight-forward; it establishes the key through a I-V-I progression and then
begins arpeggiating the I chord. On the downbeat of the the third measure,
however, a diminished seventh chord appears that does not function as any
diminished seventh chord we have seen. Usually, a diminished seventh chord is
a dominant function of the chord that it precedes. In this case, we have
D\#o7, which, if it were a secondary leading-tone chord, would resolve to a
chord with the root of an E--in this key, it would likely be a viio7/iii.
Instead, it goes back to the I chord. The notable features of this resolution
though, are that three of the pitches resolve smoothly by step-wise motion to
the pitches of the I chord while the last pitch is a common-tone between the
two chords. You could analyze this as an entire chord that functions as both
neighbor tones and a pedal tone, but that does not truly describe its
function. So what is this \#iio7? - In the second example, we find the same
chord on the downbeat of the third measure, but in this example, it is
embellishing the V chord instead of the I chord. It shares the same
voice-leading principles as the previous example did with the I chord--three
neighbor tones and one common tone--as the previous example, but instead of
being built as \#iio7, it is now a \#vio7 that decorates a V chord. - The last
example is the most complicated. The progression begins with a I chord moving
to a vi chord, but instead of going to a diatonic predominant, it moves to a
V6/V. This does not go directly to a V chord, however, and instead passes
through a strange diminished seventh chord on the beat 3 of the second
measure, an E\#o7. While the neighbor tones of the previous example are
slightly altered in this case in that they all of our neighbor tones are now
passing tones. The chord still has many commonalities to the previous
examples, though, in that it is still a diminished seventh chord that is
surrounded by the same harmony on both sides and it shares a common-tone with
those chords.

\hypertarget{common-tone-diminished-chords}{%
\section{Common-tone diminished chords}\label{common-tone-diminished-chords}}

Each of the chromatic chords above is an example of \emph{common-tone
diminished chord}. You will label these chords as \textbf{cto7}.

Common-tone diminished chords: - Are stacks of minor thirds which creates a
fully diminished seventh chord. - When you encounter these in an analysis, you
will likely assume that it is a secondary leading-tone chord, but you will
quickly notice that it does not resolve correctly. - Can be used to embellish
\emph{any} major triad or dominant seventh chord. - cto7 most often embellish
either I or V (and V7). - These chords do not work well for non-major triads
because there will be more than one common tone. For example, a minor triad
would have two common tones with its cto7, and this weakens the voice leading.
- Share a common tone with the root of the chord to which they resolve. - It
is common for the same chord to precede the cto7, but not a requirement. - The
three non-common tones will resolve by step to the closest chord tone. - For
major triads, this means that the chordal fifth will likely need to be
doubled. - For dominant seventh chords, each non-common tone resolves by
half-step to the closest chord tone. - Do not have their own primary function
(i.e.~tonic, dominant, pre-dominant) and instead elongate another chord's
function. - Are always labeled with only o7. - They have no standard
inversion, so they do not require an inversion figure. As with all fully
diminished seventh chords, they can be enharmonically spelled in four
different ways, and the voice leading of the passage will determine how the
chord should be spelled. - The two most common cto7 chords are those that
embellish the I and V chords. These will most likely be spelled as \#iio7 and
\#vio7 respectively, because these provide the correct voice leading.

As discussed repeatedly in this course, diatonic harmony and its progressions
work because of the strength of the voice-leading. To prove this, let's listen
to the following standard progression. As you listen, pay special attention to
the voice-leading. Do you consider this progression to have strong
voice-leading? If so, what makes it strong? If not, what makes it weak and
what could strengthen it?

\{\% capture ex1 \%\}X:1 T:Basic diatonic progression M:4/4 L:1 K:C V:1

Most students when presented with these questions determine that the strength
of the progression comes from three things: - The overall smoothness of the
voice-leading in the upper voices - The ``pull'' from certain tendency tones
toward another - The strong, repetitive pattern of the bass voice

Between any two chords with roots separated by descending P5, there is one
common tone and two voices that resolve by step. If we remove the bass voice,
we can clearly see (and hear) the smooth voice-leading between these chords
while still using complete chords. (The tenor voice has been written in treble
clef to make it easier to see the voice-leading. Its octave is not altered.)

By quantifying this aspect of voice-leading--the ``smoothness'' between two
chords--we can study how this aspect of voice-leading strengthens a
progression. In the simplified progression above, count the half-steps
necessary to move between each of the two chords. Which chords have the
smoothest voice-leading? Which are the most disjunct? Does this line up with
what you would have expected?

\hypertarget{idealized-voice-leading-intervals-ivi}{%
\section{Idealized Voice-leading Intervals
(IVI)}\label{idealized-voice-leading-intervals-ivi}}

Counting the half-steps necessary for resolution in idealized voice-leading
will be helpful to us as we explore more advanced harmonic concepts, because
it gives us a tool to quantify something that is relatively subjective--what
makes good voice-leading. We will call this process Idealized Voice-leading
Intervals (IVI). You can do this between any two chords by: - Writing both
chords next to each other in closed position. - Inverting one of the chords to
minimize the distance necessary to resolve the two chords. - Counting the
half-steps necessary to resolve the progression.

When counting the half-steps in the the above progression, you hopefully found
that the movement from ii to V was the ``weakest'' voice-leading and required
four half-steps to resolve. The next strongest resolutions were vi to ii and V
to I. Both of these resolutions require only three half-steps. But in a
surprise twist, the winner of the smoothest voice-leading in the above
progression, was not a standard function progression at all; it was the I
chord moving to the vi chord to start the progression. This happens because it
has \emph{two} common tones rather than just the one associated with chords
that have roots separated by P5.

\hypertarget{mediant-harmony}{%
\section{Mediant harmony}\label{mediant-harmony}}

Let's take this one step further. Before reading on, take a moment to find the
IVI between a \textbf{C major triad} and all triads that are \textbf{diatonic
to C major or C minor}.* Rank them in order of smoothest voice-leading to
least.

As you can see the smoothest voice-leading possible between a C major triad
and a different triad is the one half-step necessary to create E minor, the
mediant. In the next closest category (two half-steps), there are three
chords: A minor (the submediant), A-flat major (the borrowed submediant), and
F minor (the borrowed subdominant). Of the four smoothest chords, three are
chords whose roots are separated by a third.

Anytime a progression has two chords whose roots are separated by a M3 or a
m3, we call this \emph{mediant harmony}. (Do not confuse this with tertian
harmony; tertian harmony is any harmony that uses chords built by stacking
thirds. This has nothing to do with the root movement within a progression.)
Rather than the structured rules and tendency tones of standard diatonic
harmony, mediant harmony relies on the smoothness of voice-leading between two
chords to create interesting new colors and progressions within a somewhat
tonal framework.

\hypertarget{finding-and-labeling-mediants}{%
\section{Finding and labeling mediants}\label{finding-and-labeling-mediants}}

For any major or minor triad, there are eight possible mediant chords: one
major and one minor chord for each of the four mediant pitches. For example,
the four mediant pitches for C are E (mediant), E-flat (borrowed mediant), A
(submediant), and A-flat (borrowed submediant). Each of these four pitches can
have either a major or minor chord built off of it for a total of eight
possible mediant chords.

Before looking at the completed chart below, find the IVI for each of the
eight possible chords. After you group the mediants by IVI, also note how many
common tones there are between the C major and each chord.

\hypertarget{conclusions-30}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-30}}

All mediant harmonies for a C major triad:

There are three categories of mediants. The following descriptions compare
describe the relationship to any major or minor chord:

\emph{Diatonic mediants} (2 possible chords) - Have two common tones - Have
the opposite chord quality - Have an IVI of 1 or 2 - Found as the diatonic
mediant chord and submediant chord

\emph{Chromatic mediants} (4 possible chords) - Have one common tone - Have
the same chord quality - Have an IVI of 2 or 3 - Found as: - EITHER the
diatonic mediant chord and submediant chord \emph{from the parallel
minor/major mode} (2) - OR the triads built by \emph{changing the chord

minor become E major and A minor becomes A major)

\emph{Doubly chromatic mediants} (2 possible chords) - Have zero common tones
- Have the opposite chord quality - Have an IVI of 3 or 4 - Found by changing

\section{Using IVI in Analysis}\label{using-ivi-in-analysis}}

Listen to the following progression. It will not sound like a standard
diatonic progression, but at the same time, it will likely sound like a
convincing modulation from a C major chord to a B-flat major chord. You may
even hear the last two chords as a cadence. Is it possible for you to analyze
this using normal Roman numeral analysis?

\{\% capture ex3 \%\}X:3 T:Mediant progression M:4/4 L:1 K:C V:1

In this progression, Roman numerals cease to have a meaningful role because
the chords do not follow standard function. What good is using Roman numerals
if a iii chord can function directly before the tonic chord? You \emph{could}
label this passage as beginning in C major and moving through I-bVI-iv, and
you would then need to pivot on the F major chord to become the V chord in
B-flat major. You could even analyze the D minor chord as just the arrival of
the B-flat major triad with a retardation on the A.

But none of this truly explains why this works. In passages like these-- those
that rely more on an interesting pattern of voice-leading rather than standard
function--I recommend writing Roman numerals under each chord in order to give
an approximation of what key you are hearing, but also putting an IVI number
between each pair of chords. I would analyze the above passage as:

\section{The limits of IVI}\label{the-limits-of-ivi}}

As with all tools, you must be careful with how you use Idealized
Voice-leading Intervals and mediant harmony. For example, when looking at
diatonic progressions, the order in which the chords appear matters as much as
the smoothness of the voice-leading. If you try to resolve V to ii, you have
created a regression that will likely sound displeasing to someone familiar
with tonal harmony. Also, many would say that adding a seventh to a chord
(e.g.~V becoming V7) strengthens the progression, because we have added a
second tendency tone and therefore more tonal gravity between the two chords.
But if you were to only look at IVI, adding the seventh would \emph{weaken}
the progression because it adds an extra half-step of resolution. In general,
IVI is most useful when looking at non-standard tonal progressions.

Transposition is the most commonly used set manipulation, but there is a
second commonly used function that is of equal importance to understanding pc
sets.

\hypertarget{inversion}{%
\section{Inversion}\label{inversion}}

When first studying tonal harmony, we discussed the scale degree names in
pairs: dominant/subdominant, mediant/submediant, subtonic/supertonic. For each
of these pairs, there is a duality to their naming in that they share a
relationship centered around the tonic pitch. For example, the dominant is a
P5 \emph{above} the tonic where the subdominant is a P5 \emph{below} the
tonic. They are mirrored around the central pitch, and therefore represent an
\emph{inversion} of each other.

In set theory, we can perform this same operation using intervals
(i.e.~numbers of half-steps). Take a moment to think about how to translate
the concept of inversion from traditional intervals (e.g.~P5,M3) into
pitch-class integers. What kind of results do you expect for integer notation?
Remember that to find an inversion of any musical pitch, you need two pieces
of information: the starting pitch class and the pitch class \emph{around}
which you will invert.

\hypertarget{visually-inverting-pitch-classes}{%
\section{Visually inverting pitch
classes}\label{visually-inverting-pitch-classes}}

Depending on the central pitch used to invert, pitch-class integer notation
can make inversion relatively easy. It does not require you to understand a
specialized pitch and interval system like traditional notation. Instead, it
only requires basic mathematical functions.

Before tackling the mathematical approach to inverting pitch-class integers,
let's visually explore inversion using the pitch class continuum below. For
simplicity's sake, let's start by centering our inversions around C/0. To
visually find an inversion, pick a letter/integer on the chart below. Count
the number of steps it takes to reach C/0, and then continue past C/0 for the
same number of steps. (You can think of it as balancing the scale.) Of course,
you will find that each positive integer is paired with its negative integer;
5 becomes -5, 8 becomes -8, etc. If you were to create a chart showing all
inversion pairs as letter names, what patterns do you notice about the
pairings? For example, how does the 7/-7 pair compare to the 5/-5 pair? Also,
what is the inversion for C/0? Why?

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lllllllllllllllllllllll@{}}
\toprule
-e & -t & -9 & -8 & -7 & -6 & -5 & -4 & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 &

F & F\# & G & G\# & A & A\# & B \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Your first chart should have 12 pc sets, although two of them are technically
only one pitch name -- C/0 and F\#/6 end up inverting on top of themselves
meaning that they are monads. However, as you look at the pairs, do you see a
pattern? How many \emph{unique} pc sets are there if you only look at pitch
letter names?

\hypertarget{applying-mod12}{%
\section{Applying Mod12}\label{applying-mod12}}

As you hopefully can see, there are only six \emph{unique} inversion pairs
once you eliminate duplicates by examining pitch letters. However, when we
instead look at the pitch-class integers, you still have 12 unique pc sets
because negative numbers differentiate the sets. You have just demonstrated
the importance of using Mod12 to simplify all pc sets to only include integers
between 0 and 11. (This is also a visual demonstration of how \emph{octave
equivalency} works.) If you look at the chart below, you can see what happens
when we apply Mod12 to a series of integers; it creates a continuously
repeating set of integers between 0 and 11, which means that inversion is as
simple as memorizing six pairs\ldots as long as you are using fixed zero/six
as your inversion axis. If you decide to invert around a different pitch
class, you will end up with six different pairs.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lllllllllllllllllllllll@{}}
\toprule
-e & -t & -9 & -8 & -7 & -6 & -5 & -4 & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 &

\endhead
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & t & e & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8
& 9 & t & e \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

This means that the inversion pairs when inverting around zero (and 6) are:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
Inversion Pair 1 & Inversion Pair 2 \\
\midrule
\endhead
0 & 0 \\
1 & e \\
2 & t \\
3 & 9 \\
4 & 8 \\
5 & 7 \\
6 & 6 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Because mod12 creates a continuously repeating series of 12 integers, you may
use the visual aid of a clock to help you find inversions. First, draw a clock
(with 0 in the place of 12). Then draw a line between 0 and 6; this line will
represents the center around which you will invert your pitches. To find your
inversion pairs, connect the integers by a line that is perpendicular to the
center line (i.e.~integers that are directly across the line), and you will
see that you create the same set of inversion pairs above. If you were to move
your center line to connect a different set of opposites, say 2 and 8, what
would this represent?

\hypertarget{finding-inversions-mathematically}{%
\section{Finding inversions
mathematically}\label{finding-inversions-mathematically}}

As with transposition, we have shorthand to represent inversion. To show the
inversions around zero used to create the chart above we would write:

T0I (0,1,2,3,4,5,6) = (0,e,t,9,8,7,6)

As you can see, each pitch class in the result is just the inversion of the
corresponding pitch class in the original pc set. If you were to put the
result in normal form you would get (6,7,8,9,t,e,0).

What if you wanted to invert \emph{and} transpose a pc set? Try inverting and
transposing the following pc set, but do it two different ways to see if you
get the same results: - Transpose first, then invert - Invert first, then
transpose

T4I(1,5,6)

Did you get the same result either way? If not, why are they different? Which
do you think is correct? Why?

\hypertarget{the-shortcut}{%
\section{The shortcut}\label{the-shortcut}}

Inverting first will always give you the correct answer, because in that case
you are inverting \emph{around zero} and then transposing. If you transpose
first, you are actually inverting around a different axis. You can think of
this easily using the clock face. If you invert first, you invert around the
0/6 axis and then you transpose the result. If you transpose first, you move
the axis of transposition, and then you invert around that.

Luckily there is a mathematical shortcut for inverting around zero and
transposing. Look at the following correctly solved examples. Do you see a
simple way to find the answers given only the numbers in the formula? It may
be helpful to think of the original number series that we used at the top of
the page, before we converted it using mod12. To make it easier to find the
shortcut, the results have purposely \emph{not} been put into normal form,
although you should always do so after inverting.

TtI(2,6,7) = (8,4,3)

T5I(2,6,7) = (3,e,t)

T9I(2,6,7) = (7,3,2)

T0I(2,6,7) = (t,6,5)

\hypertarget{conclusion-9}{%
\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-9}}

To quickly invert and transpose, just subtract each member of your pitch class
from \texttt{n} in the formula
\texttt{T\textless{}sub\textgreater{}n\textless{}/sub\textgreater{}I}. So in
the first example above, n = t.

TtI(2,6,7) = (8,4,3)

If you subtract each pitch class from the inversion interval, which is t (or
10) in this case, you will get the resulting set.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  10-2 = 8
\item
  10-6 = 4
\item
  10-7 = 3
\end{itemize}

You should get in the habit of putting these into normal form after inversion.
If you transpose a pc set in normal form, it will still be in normal form. If
you invert a pc set in normal form, you will have to find normal form again.
Usually, the normal form of an inverted set the reverse order, but there are
certain situations in which this will not be the case. You should always
double-check your normal form to be sure.

Analyze and listen to the following short progressions. There are three
progressions in major and then three similar progressions in the parallel
minor. Start your analysis with leadsheet symbols and then provide Roman
numerals. (You may want to refer back to Unit 17a to review the finer points
of using the Roman numeral system.) In each progression below, there is a
chromatic chord that will stand out. What is its function in each case?
(e.g.~tonic, passing, etc.) If you were to compare it to a diatonic or
chromatic chord that normally fulfills this function, which chord shares the
most commonalities with it? (Hint: Think about the inversion and choice of
doubled notes.) Does it seem most ``at home'' in major or minor?

\hypertarget{conclusions-31}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-31}}

As you labeled the chords, you probably noticed that you had a chord that
could only be explained as the borrowed II chord from the Phrygian mode. In
each case, it was acting as a pre-dominant chord and followed the rules of a
standard ii chord. This bII chord is used often enough that it earned a
special name: the Neapolitan chord. The origin of the chord's moniker
(Neapolitan) is disputed, but recently, one could make a case for calling this
the ``Batman'' chord; it has been featured prominently in almost every modern
Batman theme. Composers love to use this chord to add darkness to a
progression.

\hypertarget{neapolitan-chords-bii}{%
\section{Neapolitan chords (bII)}\label{neapolitan-chords-bii}}

You may label the Neapolitan chord using standard Roman numeral notation (bII)
as discussed in the mode mixture unit (Unit 17a), but it is also common to
substitute an upper-case ``N''--short for Neapolitan--in your Roman numerals.
For voice-leading purposes, the chord may sometimes have an enharmonically
equivalent pitch--such as the \texttt{G\#} shown in the third and sixth
progressions--but we still always analyze this as a bII chord.

The above examples are three of the most common ways in which you should
approach and leave a Neapolitan chord: - Directly to the V chord, most often
the V7 - Into a cadential 6/4 progression - Into a viio7/V

As you observed in the example, the bII chord is most commonly used as a
pre-dominant function. In this case, you can make the argument that it is most
similar to a pre-dominant ii chord, because it has the same scale degrees of
\^{}2, \^{}4, and \^{}6, with a lowered \^{}2 and \^{}6. While this is true,
if you look at the common doubling and inversion of the Neapolitan
chord--first inversion with a doubled third--it may be easier for you to
consider the Neapolitan as a functional substitution for a borrowed iv chord.
This ensures correct doubling and voice-leading tendencies. Look at the chords
side-by-side in below, and you will notice there is only a half-step
difference between the two chords.

include abc-example.html number=``3'' abc=ex3 \%\}

Perhaps the most important reason for this doubling is that it solves two
major part writing errors that occur for root-position bII chords: 1.
\emph{Resolving to V} - The root of the bII chord is a tendency tone and
should not be doubled as we do for many chords. The flatted second scale
degree pulls strongly downward, and when going directly to a V chord, it will
resolve downward by an interval of a diminished 3rd to the third of the V
chord. Of course, the chordal third of the V chord is also a tendency tone, so
you would create multiple parallel perfect octaves if you were to double the
root of the Neapolitan. 2. \emph{Resolving to a cadential 6/4 or a viio7/V} -
Not only is the root a tendency tone, the chordal fifth of this chord (\^{}b6)
also wants to resolve downward. If the bII chord resolves to either a
cadential 6/4 or a viio7/V, the movement between the root and chordal fifth
would create parallel perfect fifths. By using a first inversion triad and
placing the chordal third in the bass, you are free to move the root above the
chordal fifth in your voicing.

You may use a Neapolitan chord as a pre-dominant function in any progression
in which you could use a minor iv chord. In minor, there is only one chromatic
pitch (\^{}b2), but in major, you will need to lower both \^{}2 and \^{}6.

In the modal interchange video from Unit 17b, you may have noticed that one of
the progressions used a bII chord. In the same unit, we then looked at a
similar usage of the bII in the excerpt from Mahler Symphony No.~2. Let's look
at this again to refresh the details of your final analysis. How is the
Neapolitan chord different from the above examples? What is its function here?
If it is not a pre-dominant as above, then what chord from this new function
shares the most commonalities with it?

\hypertarget{conclusions-32}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-32}}

As we discussed in 17b, in this case, the bII is acting as a functional
substitution for a dominant function (or possibly a plagal cadential
function). It shares many common tones with a viio7 chord, and these tendency
tones follow the voice-leading resolutions that you would expect of a viio7.
When it is used to resolve to a I chord, the voice-leading issues are
difficult to overcome, so you must be thoughtful in your approach and
resolution.

Please note: While the Neapolitan is a commonly used chord, it is far more
common to use it as a predominant function rather than as a functional
substitution for dominant. Remember that if you ignore the standard
tonic/dominant relationship too often, the listener will begin to lose the
sense of diatonic progression. This can be good or bad depending on your
desired outcome.

As always, if you study a chord's voice-leading, you can use this to deduce
its function.

Secondary chords can be extended beyond the dominant function, creating
further tonicization of a chosen chord.

\hypertarget{extending-toniczation}{%
\section{Extending toniczation}\label{extending-toniczation}}

For the following chorale, provide leadsheet symbols and a Roman numeral
analysis. There are multiple chromatically-altered chords, some of which
cannot be explained as secondary dominant or secondary leading-tone chords.
And while it might be tempting to label a minor v chord in your analysis, that
doesn't explain what the listener is hearing. Instead focus on looking for
``pockets'' of tonality, in which you might be able to explain a progression
easier through the lens of another key.

As with all analysis, you should never dwell too much on an individual chord
in your first attempt. If you get stuck, just move to the next chord. It is
helpful to start with leadsheet symbols when working with chromatic harmony,
because it allows you to label chords by their construction before worrying
about each chord's function and relationships.

At first glance (and hearing), the G minor triad seems starkly out of place.
We have seen minor v chords in previous examples, but in each case, they
followed the defined conventions of one of our alternate functions such as a
passing or pedal functions. Here, the minor v chord does not fit any of our
known functions, so we need to examine the context of this example.

The chord following the G minor triad is a clear V4/2/ii which then resolves
to a ii6 chord. If you look through your leadsheet symbols, you can clearly
see a pattern that extends backwards if you continue thinking in the key of ii
(D minor). In the key of ii, a G minor chord is a diatonic iv chord, which
would make this a iv-V-i progression in that key. Therefore, the correct
labeling of this example is iv/ii -- V4/2/ii -- ii6. Without a stable cadence,
we have not changed keys, but this progression clearly emphasizes and extends
our pre-dominant harmony.

\hypertarget{secondary-or-diatonic}{%
\section{Secondary or diatonic?}\label{secondary-or-diatonic}}

Because of the nature of diatonic progressions, there is a great deal of
crossover between non-dominant secondary functions and the actual diatonic
chords of a key. Provide a Roman numeral analysis of the following chorale,
paying particular attention to the second chord. Is it diatonic or a secondary
function?

\hypertarget{conclusion-11}{%
\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-11}}

The second chord, the A minor triad, is clearly a vi chord in the key of C
major. It is worth noting however, that because this chord is followed by a
secondary dominant, this chord also functions perfectly in the secondary key
as a non-dominant secondary function. The third chord is a V7/V which
tonicizes the key of G major. If you extend this key backwards, the A minor
chord functions as a ii/V chord.

You do not need to label this as anything other than a vi chord in C major,
because it is fulfilling its standard diatonic function in every way. However,
this further illustrates how fluid harmony can become when thinking of the
relationships between keys and voice-leading.

Look at the following example. In both cases, the starting interval contains
enharmonically equivalent pitches of a tri-tone. In the first measure it is
notated as an A4, but in the second measure, it is notated as a d5. What
harmony do you think is implied in these two measures? How does the choice of
using D-flat or C-sharp change the resolution in a tonal context?

In a tonal context, there is an important difference between enharmonically
equivalent pitches such as D-flat and C-sharp. In the example above, the A4
between G and C-sharp implies the outward resolution of a V4/2 to I6 in the
key of D major. In the second progression, changing the C-sharp to a D-flat
creates a d5 that implies an inward resolution of a V6/5 to I in the key of
A-flat major. Clearly, the pitch notation system we use is designed to show
harmonic movement in a tonal setting.

\hypertarget{leaving-tonality}{%
\section{Leaving tonality}\label{leaving-tonality}}

As we move toward music that no longer relies on tonal harmony, the tools with
which we notate analysis reflect the lack of a traditional tonal center. If a
piece does not rely on the tonic and dominant relationship to provide tension
and release, the importance of Roman numerals, scale degrees, and even pitch
names becomes less useful. They are derived from a system that prioritizes
seven pitches at a given time, so without that requirement, we need a method
for demonstrating the relationships between all twelve chromatic pitches.

Look at the following ornamented melody. The numbers below the staff denote
the \emph{pitch class} for each pitch. (Note that \texttt{t} = 10, \texttt{e}
= 11) Each number is considered a \emph{pitch class} (abbrev.: pc), and the
system itself is called \emph{pitch-class (pc) integer notation}. After
studying this example, what can you determine about the pitch classes? How do
you determine which pitches are in a pitch-class? Is this numbering built
around a key center or just a particular pitch? While it should be obvious
that this system would not be ideal for analyzing tonic and dominant centers,
what kinds of information \emph{does} this system demonstrate?

\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-12}}

As you can see, pitch-class integer notation assigns a unique integer to all
enharmonically equivalent pitches. This particular example is labeled in
\emph{fixed zero}, meaning that C=0, and every pitch is counted as half-steps
from that point. This system is wonderful for showing intervals quickly,
because each number is actually counting the number of half-steps away from
zero. For fixed zero, D is two half steps away from zero, A is nine half steps
away, and so on. Therefore, when you look at the numbers, you know that if the
difference between two numbers is small, it is a small interval. Large
distances equate to large intervals.

Look at the following chart for the pitch class of every pitch in fixed-zero
pc integer notation. Note that this chart does not include double-sharps or
double-flats, but \emph{any pitch} can be included along with its enharmonic
equivalents.

\section{Movable-zero pc integer
notation}\label{movable-zero-pc-integer-notation}}

Much like solfege, there is another system for labeling pitches in pc integer
notation. Look at the following scales taken from Unit 21. Each scale is
labeled using pc integer notation, but C no longer equals 0. First, figure out
what scale is represented on each line, and then look at how the numbering
system is adjusted. How are the numbers determined? What does having a
\emph{movable zero} demonstrate?

You can see that using movable-zero pc integer notation allows you to set 0 to
the most important pitch for a given set of pitches, and then base every
number around that pitch. In the first example, the D major scale labels D as
the central pitch and then counts the half-steps away from that D. The second
line assigns E as 0 to show the intervallic structure of the E dorian mode,
and the last line assigns F as 0 to show the intervallic structure of an F HW
octatonic scale.

This does make it easy to see the intervals within each scale, but to be
honest, standard interval labels (e.g.~M2 and m3) do a similar job while also
implying context. Movable-zero notation is actually best used for looking for
patterns within subsets of pitches. Look at the next example which uses the
exact same three scales, but instead of having only one zero, it assigns 0 to
multiple pitches within the same scale. What patterns do you see emerge? Can
you think of other ways to potentially use this?

\{\% capture ex4 \%\}X:4 T:Scales labeled using multiple zeros in pc integer

By using movable zero to highlight certain collections of pitch classes, you
can show intervallic patterns within these collections. For a major scale,
there are two (0245) collections separated by a whole step. For a Dorian mode,
there are two (0235) collections separated by a whole step. And for a HW
octatonic scale, there are two (0134) collections separated by a whole step.
What scale would two (0235) collections separated by a half-step create?

Any time we have a collections of pitch classes, this is called a
\emph{pitch-class set} (abbrev: pcs). A pitch-class set can be any number of
pitches, and we call the number of pitches within a pcs its
\emph{cardinality}. Each cardinality has a special name shown in the chart
below.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}

In the second scale example above, we used pc integer notation to show
specific tetrachords within common scales. {[}0245{]} is often called the
``major'' tetrachord, {[}0235{]} is often called the ``minor'' tetrachord,
and{[}0134{]} is often called the ``diminished'' or ``octatonic'' tetrachord.
What tetrachord do you think is most associated with the whole-tone scale?
What other scales make use of these tetrachords?

\hypertarget{introduction-to-set-theory}{%
\section{Introduction to set theory}\label{introduction-to-set-theory}}

Pitch-class integer notation is really the beginning of \emph{set theory}, a
system that was first laid out by Allen Forte in \emph{The Structure of Atonal
Music}, and since been refined by many other theorists. Notably, Joseph Straus
created a wonderful teaching method for set theory in his \emph{Introduction
to Post-Tonal Theory}. Both are amazing references and if you need to explore
the topic further, I recommend that you start with these after reading through
the set theory overview of Unit 22.

When you perform a harmonic analysis, you are attempting to explain how a
listener hears a harmonic progression and why it sounds either functional or
non-functional to that person. To do so, we rely on our understanding of
diatonic tendencies and voice-leading to explain likely listener
interpretations, in the same way that a composer relies on their musical
knowledge to elicit a desired reaction from a listener.

Once we go beyond looking at the fundamental aspects of music -- rhythm,
intervals, chords, keys, etc. -- and begin combining these concepts to analyze
function, we must begin to organize music into structures that combine rhythm,
pitch, and timbre into complete musical ideas.

A \emph{motive} is the smallest identifiable fragment of music. It can be a
short melodic fragment, a short harmonic progression, a distinct rhythm, or a
combination of these things. A composer can take a motive and build an entire
work around it through various transformations, but it will always retain some
fundamental relationships of pitch, rhythm, or both.

A \emph{phrase} is the complete musical idea built to support a motive. The
most common analogy used to describe a phrase is to compare it to a ``musical
sentence.'' A good written or verbal sentence has a clear beginning, middle,
and end. It has a few required structures and often some decorative parts to
provide more specific function. This is exactly how a musical phrase works. It
has a clear beginning, middle, and end; it has required structures to define
its function; and it can be manipulated, decorated, and transformed to relate
to the ideas that surround it. Phrases can sometimes be divided into
\emph{sub-phrases}, but these sub-phrases do not function independently;
instead, sub-phrases are best thought of as motives with their supporting
textures.

\hypertarget{identifying-phrases}{%
\section{Identifying phrases}\label{identifying-phrases}}

Now that you have a basic understanding of harmonic progressions, harmonic
function, labeling function with Roman numerals, and cadences, you can combine
these ideas to explore musical phrases. - After listening to Mozart's \emph{An
Die Freude} multiple times (found below), mark the beginning and ending of
each phrase based on your listening. - Remember that each phrase should sound
like a complete musical idea with a clear beginning, middle, and end. - Once
you have established these, label the last two chords of each phrase using
Roman numerals and inversion figures. - Do each of your phrase endings fit one
of the cadences discussed in Unit 7c? If so, label the cadence below the Roman
numerals. - Identify at least one motive and describe what are defining
characteristics of the motive. Rhythm? Specific intervals? Repeated
progressions? - Find multiple iterations of your motive. How does Mozart
transform it throughout the piece? - Once you have completed each of these
steps, discuss what you think defines a phrase. What are the essential
components?

Because this piece only has two voices, many chords will have more than one
option for a harmony, so you must use the harmonic flowchart from the
beginning of this chapter to choose the most likely harmony based on function.
For example, if a harmony only has \texttt{mi} and \texttt{sol}, this could be
either a I chord or a iii chord. If you put it into context, however, it will
become clear what harmony the listener is likely to hear. If the harmony with
\texttt{mi} and \texttt{sol} is preceded by \texttt{fa} and \texttt{sol}, it
is highly unlikely that this is a iii chord. \texttt{fa} and \texttt{sol}
outline a V7 harmony, and a V chord will not resolve to a iii chord. Instead
the listener will hear this as a V chord resolving to a I chord -- albeit an
unstable I chord.

Also note that this piece has multiple modulations that I have marked into the
score. We will cover modulations in a later unit, but for now, make sure to
analyze each phrase ending in the correct key. If you do not, your cadences
will not make sense.

A phrase is a complete musical idea that: - has a clear sense of harmonic
progression. - ends with a cadence. - has a melodic structure that creates
tension and release. - ends with longer rhythmic values to create a sense of
slowing.

In this piece, each phrase is four measures long, and most musical pieces will
establish a ``standard'' phrase length. This is not a defining feature of
phrases, though, because many composers prefer to have varied phrase lengths
in their compositions to keep the listener engaged.

\hypertarget{the-benefit-of-using-leadsheet-symbols-in-analysis}{%
\section{The benefit of using leadsheet symbols in
analysis}\label{the-benefit-of-using-leadsheet-symbols-in-analysis}}

As we leave strict diatonic function and begin to explore chromatic
alterations and modulation, one of the most difficult challenges in analysis
is discerning what tonic is implied at any given moment. Roman numeral
analysis shows function--tonic, dominant, etc.,--but it shows this through
each chord's relationship to tonic. Simply put, you cannot write a Roman
numeral if you do not know your tonic. On the other hand, leadsheet notation
is limited in that it does not show how a chord functions, but it \emph{does}
provide a way to examine a chord quality independent of key or tonic. An F
major chord could be a I chord in F major, a IV chord in C major, a III chord
in D-flat major, and many others, but it will always be an F major chord.

Leadsheet notation does not rely on any pre-existing knowledge of the piece,
and because of this, it is helpful to use this system as a shorthand when you
begin analyzing a piece--particularly those with the potential for
modulations. As you start analyzing an unfamiliar section of music it is
helpful to write leadsheet symbols above the staff so that you can quickly
reference them once you have completed a larger section of the music. This
will allow you to look for patterns within chord progressions rather than
having to repeatedly re-examine every chord each time that you discover
something new.

\hypertarget{simple-modulations-and-common-chords}{%
\section{Simple modulations and common
chords}\label{simple-modulations-and-common-chords}}

The simplest modulation is one that uses standard functional progressions and
produces modulations through slight changes. Analyze the following excerpt
from a Haydn piano sonata using leadsheet symbols. Even though there is only
one altered note, it clearly ends in a different key than the key in which it
starts. To begin understanding how this modulation works, ask these key
questions: 1. Where do you first \emph{hear} something changing? 2. How is the
change prepared? 3. What harmonies transition into and out of the modulation?

Once you have answered these, create Roman numerals for \emph{both the
beginning key and the ending key}. (This will require secondary function
chords.) When looking at the Roman numeral progressions, you can see where the
progressions function diatonically and where they emphasize non-tonic chords
such as the subdominant.

\hypertarget{conclusion-13}{%
\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-13}}

The example begins in the key of G major but ends in the key of D major. The
first two bars clearly establish G major and end with an authentic cadence on
beats 2, 3, and 4 of the second measure. The third measure also begins in G
major, but beats 3 and 4 have a chromatic tone (C-sharp) as part of an A7
chord used to tonicize D major. This tonicization is then solidified through
an authentic cadence in D major in measure 4, completing the modulation.

If you attempt to analyze this excerpt in only one of the two keys, you do not
create a convincing explanation of what you hear in either key. In G major,
the second phrase requires many secondary dominants and results in a
\emph{heavily} tonicized V chord at the end. Conversely, if we try to analyze
the first phrase in D major, we end up with a progression that looks as if
it's operating entirely in the key of IV.

When you look at the analyses in both keys on top of each like this however,
there is one point at which the progression makes sense in \emph{both} keys.
At the beginning of the measure three, the listener will hear the G major
triad as a continuation of the I chord from the previous cadence. This chord
can also act as the diatonic IV chord in the key of D major. Therefore, this
moment is both the conclusion of V-I in G major as well as the beginning of a
IV-V-I progression in D major. This is an exemplar of a \emph{pivot chord}.

A pivot chord is a chord that allows the composer to smoothly modulate between
two keys. Any chord can be used to pivot between two keys, but this chord must
be part of a \textbf{functional progression} in \emph{both} keys to be
considered a pivot chord. If a chord does not have an obvious function on both
sides of the pivot, it is not a pivot modulation. We will discuss the other
modulatory techniques in the next topic.

\hypertarget{common-chords-between-keys}{%
\section{Common chords between keys}\label{common-chords-between-keys}}

The smoothest pivot chords will be diatonic to both keys, although we will
study some common non-diatonic chords in Unit 16c. In the example above, if
you pivot anywhere other than the G major chord that bridges the first and
second phrases, you must use a secondary dominant. By having a chord that is
diatonic to both keys, the transition between the two keys is as smooth as
possible. The less strong the pivot chord's function in both keys, the more
jarring the modulation will be.

When a modulation centers around a common chord between two keys, we call this
a \emph{common chord pivot modulation}. To better understand why
closely-related keys create smoother modulations, it is helpful to look at the
number of common chords between the two keys. In the following chart, I have
listed each chord from C major and G major, but I have aligned them by root
rather than by scale degree.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
C major & Chord & Chord & G major \\
\midrule
\endhead
I & \textbf{C maj} & \textbf{C maj} & IV \\
ii & D min & D maj & V \\
iii & \textbf{E min} & \textbf{E min} & vi \\
IV & F maj & F\#o & viio \\
V & \textbf{G maj} & \textbf{G maj} & I \\
vi & \textbf{A min} & \textbf{A min} & ii \\
viio & Bo & B min & iii \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

You can see that the two keys share four common chords (highlighted in bold),
so writing a smooth progression in both keys is fairly easy because it can
rely on multiple common chords. Try creating a table like this for
distantly-related keys such as C major and E major. What about G major and F
minor? You will find that closely related keys share many more common chords
than distantly related keys.

\hypertarget{pivot-chords-and-modulation-points}{%
\section{Pivot chords and modulation
points}\label{pivot-chords-and-modulation-points}}

As described above, the \emph{pivot chord} of a pivot chord modulation is more
than just a chord that is common to both keys. A pivot chord smoothly
transitions from one key to another because it is part of a functional
progression in \emph{both} the old and the new keys. The simpler the pivot's
progression, the less-jarring the modulation.

In the previous topic, we listened to an excerpt from the third movement of
the second movement of Tchaikovsky's Symphony No.~5. Analyze this piece
beginning with leadsheet symbols, then add Roman numerals from the beginning
until you get to the \emph{modulation point} -- the place where you first hear
the modulation.

\textbf{Common chord pivots occur \emph{right before you hear} the modulation
point.}

To show a modulation: - Draw a bracket that provides an area on top and
bottom. Your bracket needs to have more than one line, otherwise it resemble a
slash and therefore a secondary function. - On the top part of the bracket,
show the Roman numeral for the pivot chord in the original key. - On the
bottom part of the bracket, name the new key (using an upper/lower case letter
followed by a colon) as well as the Roman numeral for the pivot chord in this
new key.

What makes this modulation work so well? More specifically, how strong is the
progression before and after the pivot chord?

\hypertarget{secondary-leading-tone-chords}{%
\section{Secondary leading-tone chords}\label{secondary-leading-tone-chords}}

Just as we can tonicize non-tonic chords by borrowing their dominant chords,
we can also tonicize non-tonic chords by borrowing the leading-tone chord
(viio) from that same key. A secondary leading-tone chord follows all of the
same voice-leading rules as if it were written in the borrowed key.

There are two different ways to explore secondary leading-tone
chords(viio/x)--through functional substitution as a dominant chord or through
functional substitution as a pre-dominant chord.

\hypertarget{secondary-leading-tone-chords-through-functional-substitution}{%
\section{Secondary leading-tone chords through functional
substitution}\label{secondary-leading-tone-chords-through-functional-substitution}}

In Unit 11b, we introduced the idea of functional substitution as a way to
explore how chords with similar functions are related. To better understand
the voice-leading of viio chords, I asked you to think of them as V7 chords
without the root. This explains why viio breaks many of standard part-writing
doubling conventions. - You \emph{should not} double the root, because it's a
tendency tone\ldots like the third of the V7 chord. - You \emph{should} double
the chordal third, because it is not a tendency tone\ldots like the fifth of
the V7 chord.

First, harmonize the following example as written, and then turn the ii7 chord
into a V7/V by adding the appropriate accidental.

In doing this, you have created a well-voiced secondary dominant seventh
chord, V7/V that should look something like this:

To turn this into a secondary \emph{leading-tone} chord, you need to replace
the root--in this case, the pitch D--with a note from viio/V. While this is a
simple statement, I hope that you remember our discussions of the difficulties
in voicing a viio triad. You do not want to double the tendency tones, because
one of them will need to resolve incorrectly to avoid objectionable parallels
with each other. And because there are so many tendency tones--the root,
fifth, and seventh of any viio7 are all tendency tones--you need to be careful
of where each voice is placed to avoid parallelisms, poor resolutions, and
spacing errors.

As you work on revoicing your V7/V, take note of which pitch you choose to
double. What other changes are necessary to avoid poor resolutions? You may
choose to use any inversion for your viio/V chord, so try re-voicing using the

\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-34}}

If you tried to create your viio/V based on the V7/V voicing from above, it is
likely that you immediately ran into issues in trying to eliminate the D from
the bass chord. Substituting an A in the same octave creates parallel octaves
against the tenor. Substituting an F-sharp in the same octave creates parallel
octaves against the alto. You could frustrate the leading tone in the alto as
a workaround, but the fact remains: viio \emph{triads} are difficult to use as
a dominant function with good voice-leading, and there is no straightforward
answer to the above exercise that does not result in some compromise.

\section{Adding a seventh}\label{adding-a-seventh}}

It is much easier to use a viio as a seventh chord. In the following example,
try to using a viio7/V using the provided bass line. You may use either a
fully diminished or half-diminished seventh chord in this example.

\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-14}}

As you can see, the part-writing mostly takes care of itself in voicing this
chord as long as you resolve the tendency tones correctly. The most obvious
solution is listed below. Notice that the resolutions are smooth and allow
every tendency tone to resolve correctly without creating objectionable
parallels.

Because this is a functional substitution for a V/V chord, the root and fifth
of the viio7/V are acting as if they were the third and seventh of the V6/5/V
chord. You can see this when you voice the two chords side-by-side.

\section{Secondary leading-tone chords through similar
chords}\label{secondary-leading-tone-chords-through-similar-chords}}

It is also helpful to approach secondary leading-tone chords by exploring the
dual nature of their function. To this point, we have focused on their role as
dominant function chords in a second key. For example, we have shown
repeatedly that a V7/V functions as the V chord \emph{in the key of} V. This
explains their voice-leading, but it does not address their \emph{actual}
function within the progression as a whole in the home key--the key of I. In
the home key, the V7/V takes the place of a \emph{pre-dominant} chord, most
often replacing a ii chord.

This can be applied to viio7/x as well. Notice that the roots of both dominant
function chords--V and viio--and the roots of pre-dominant chords--ii and
IV--are separated by the interval of a third. If we add this observation to
the idea that a V/V chord is a functional substitution for a ii chord, it
reasons that a viio chord is therefore a functional substitution for a IV
chord. They share a function and have a root that is a third higher than their
more commonly used counterpart.

You can demonstrate this by harmonizing the following diatonic progression.
Once you have a harmonization with good voice-leading, alter the IV6 chord to
become the viio7 chord from the key of the chord you will be tonicizing--in
this case, the viio7 from G major. What note(s) do you have to alter to
achieve this? How do these notes relate to a V7/V? Did you have to re-voice
this to accommodate the alterations?

After having done this, do you feel that viio is more closely related to ii7
or IV? Why?

Now that we understand how circle-of-fifths progressions within a key create a
basic harmonic ``outline,'' we can use that pattern to begin analyzing
harmony. The framework of these progressions can be used to organize any piece
of music in this tradition and allows us to ask the two fundamental questions
of all harmonic analysis: - How are expectations created in the music? - Which
pitches are functional in creating these expectations?

Regardless of the complexity or era of a composition, if a theorist can answer
these questions about a piece, they can analyze the qualities that define that
style of composition.

\hypertarget{a-first-attempt-at-harmonic-analysis}{%
\section{A first attempt at harmonic
analysis}\label{a-first-attempt-at-harmonic-analysis}}

As we progress through the examples below, we will develop a process for
analyzing a piece of tonal music. Students often think that ``analyzing'' a
piece of music simply involves identifying and labeling a bunch of chords, but
as you move through this, be aware that \emph{the goal of harmonic analysis is
to explain how the listener hears the music}. While the first step is
identifying harmonies, it is far more involved than that, so as you move past
the first step of identifying chords, I encourage you to make a list of all
the questions and decisions that you encounter as you work.

\textbf{Study the following chorale, and provide a Roman numeral and inversion
figure below every new harmony. As you go through this process, keep track of
the questions that you solve as well as what makes this difficult. Start by
looking at the big picture, and do not get bogged down in trying to figure out
every pitch and chord at first glance. If you get stuck, keep moving and
return to the difficult sections after you have a feel for the piece as a
whole. You should also consider starting with leadsheet notation until you are
confident of the key of the piece; you can then return to add Roman numerals
once you have more context.}

\hypertarget{conclusions-35}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-35}}

To do this, there are three primary questions that must be answered in a
harmonic analysis: - What is the harmonic rhythm? (i.e.~How often does the
harmony change?) - Which pitches are chord tones and non-chord tones? - Which
pitches, if any, are omitted but implied by the context?

\hypertarget{harmonic-rhythm}{%
\subsubsection{Harmonic rhythm}\label{harmonic-rhythm}}

We will tackle the second and third questions in the example below, but before
you can begin to analyze the chords within a piece, you need to figure out how
often the chords change. This concept is called \emph{harmonic rhythm}. It is
different for every piece; sometimes it will be every beat as in the chorale
above, but other pieces will have irregular patterns and/or many measures
before new harmonies.

Determining harmonic rhythm is intuitively obvious to most musicians while
listening, but can be difficult to illustrate when looking only at the music.
This is often a chicken-or-the-egg question: you need to know how often the
chord changes to determine which pitches to include in the chord, but you also
need to look at which pitches create chords to figure out how often the chord
changes. Chorales are an easy place to start, because most often, they change
chords in a consistent rhythm--in this case, every beat--and this creates an
easy-to-see visual cue as each chord is stacked vertically and mostly
homorhythmic. For more complicated textures, studying melodic patterns and
bass-lines is often enough to provide enough context for an educated guess.
Bass-lines in particular will often sustain pitches and/or outline chords
until the harmony changes, and this gives a clear indicator of probable
harmonic rhythm. This becomes much easier as the student gains experience.

\hypertarget{omittedimplied-chord-tones}{%
\subsubsection{Omitted/implied chord tones}\label{omittedimplied-chord-tones}}

The Old Hundreth Psalm has a number of incomplete chords, and this may not be
obvious at first glance. To fill in the missing pieces, music theorists use a
number of tools, most of which are designed to look at contextual clues and
draw conclusions based on their general knowledge. We created one of these
tools in Unit 7a with the diatonic harmony flowchart.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lllll@{}}
\toprule
(\emph{unnamed}) & (\emph{unnamed}) & pre-dominant & dominant & tonic \\
\midrule
\endhead
iii & vi & ii & V & I \\
& & IV & viio & \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

By employing the progressions from this flowchart, a theorist can look at a
given harmony and decide which pitches support a harmonic progression that is
\emph{likely} to be heard by a listener, even if those tones are not present.

\hypertarget{embellishments}{%
\section{Embellishments}\label{embellishments}}

One of the most difficult issues to tackle in harmonic analysis is determining
\emph{which pitches are functional}. - Which pitches define how the listener
``hears'' the music? - Which pitches could be removed without changing the
basic effect? - Which pitches are added solely to provide variety?

\textbf{Analyze the following embellished first phrase of the Old Hundredth
Psalm. Which notes are not necessary for the harmonic function? How would you
describe their motion? If you are struggling to determine whether it belongs
or not, try referring to your the harmonic outline that you built in the
previous topic \href{07-harmonic-functions/a1-diaprogcirclefifths.html}{Unit
7a}. Does the voice-leading--i.e.~how each chordal member resolves--work with
the rules that you established in Unit 7a if you do not have a non-chord
tone?}

\hypertarget{conclusion-15}{%
\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-15}}

The essential pitches of any harmony are those that if removed, would
noticeably alter the way the listener hears the harmony. As you attempted to
analyze this decorated melody, were you able to see and hear the basic
framework from the first phrase of the Old Hundredth? If so, it should have
allowed you to figure out both the harmonic rhythm as well as which pitches
were decorative.

The harmonic rhythm stayed the same; one chord per quarter note, even though
the voices were often filled double the amount of notes.

From there, you must consider a number of factors to determine which notes are
embellishments. - Which pitches are on the strong beats? - Are any pitches
repeated? - Is one pitch more dissonant against the other chord tones?
Differentiating between chord tones and non-chord tones is the key to deciding
a chord's function.

\hypertarget{before-moving-forward}{%
\section{Before moving forward\ldots{}}\label{before-moving-forward}}

As you answered each of these questions, you began understanding how harmony
\emph{functions}. Even without much guidance, you can use your knowledge of
musical fundamentals--intervals, chords, melodic lines, Roman numeral
labeling, etc.--to create a sketch of the harmonic underpinnings of this
chorale.

We use chorales to begin studying analysis because of the vertical nature of
the writing. Every chord in this composition is aligned to where it can be
easily parsed by sight, and almost every tone is functional. As you look at
other musical styles, try to reduce the music down to a simpler texture--one
that resembles a chorale voicing--if you cannot answer the basic questions of
finding harmonic rhythm and chord tones.

\hypertarget{pitch-systems-and-an-introduction-to-solfege}{%
\section{Pitch systems and an introduction to
solfege}\label{pitch-systems-and-an-introduction-to-solfege}}

There are many methods for labeling pitches, and these vary based on language
of origin, style of music, pedagogy, and analytical purposes. In this
textbook, we will primarily reference the widely-used English-language
notation system that employs seven letter names and accidentals. This system
is discussed below and is sufficient for differentiating between pitches in a
diatonic tonality system. (If the terms \emph{diatonic} and \emph{tonality}
don't mean anything to you yet, don't worry; we'll cover those terms in later
units.)

There are times, however, in which we want to discuss the \emph{concept} of a
tonal structure without tying ourselves to a particular tonal center, and we
often see this concept in our every day lives. Take, for example, the common
occurrence of a group of people spontaneously bursting into
song--e.g.~everyone singing \emph{Happy Birthday} at a niece's birthday party.
These people do not likely have formal musical training and no one chooses a
particular key, but the song is still completely recognizable.
(Usually.)Instead, they start singing and their voice finds a comfortable key
based on their vocal range. They do this by intuiting \emph{the relative
distance between pitches} rather than using a predetermined set of pitches. So
to discuss how the distance between pitches implies tonal centers, we need a
system that demonstrates \emph{relative} distance without having to refer to
the letter system.

There are multiple pre-existing systems that define music in relative terms,
but for this textbook, we will use \emph{moveable-``do'' solfege}, a system
that evolved from some of the earliest methods of notation. In this system, we
assign the most privileged note of a scale to \texttt{do}, and then we assign
each note above that pitch a similar Latin name based on its distance from
\texttt{do}. For those of you familiar with the classic musical \emph{The
Sound of Music}, you probably already know the basic seven solfege. ``Do, a
deer, a female deer\ldots and so on.

We will discuss this system in detail in the unit on scales, but until then,
it will be helpful for you to refer to the following chart when necessary.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}

This course assumes that you have a basic knowledge of how to raise and lower

accidentals, please refer to the \emph{Further Reading} section under
\href{01-pitches-clefs//b2-labelingpitches.html}{Discussion 1b}.

\hypertarget{enharmonic-equivalence-and-pitch-classes}{%
\section{Enharmonic Equivalence and Pitch
Classes}\label{enharmonic-equivalence-and-pitch-classes}}

When studying tonal harmony, C-sharp and D-flat have unique functions and are
\emph{not} interchangeable, however, when considering their physical
properties, there is no difference between these two pitches meaning that we
consider these two pitches to be \emph{enharmonically equivalent}. At its
core, enharmonic equivalence is an easy concept: When two pitches sound the
same--meaning that they share identical
\href{https://amazing-space.stsci.edu/resources/explorations/groundup/lesson/glossary/term-full.php?t=wavelength_and_frequency}{frequencies}--but
have different note names (i.e.~letters), we consider them to be
enharmonically equivalent.

If you were to group all pitches that are enharmonic equivalents, you create a
\emph{pitch class}; such as C-sharp, D-flat, and B-double-sharp. There are
twelve pitch classes in traditional Western tonality. Every pitch has multiple
enharmonic equivalents, but some are used less frequently due to the necessity
for uncommon accidentals such as double-sharps and double-flats. Note that all
but one pitch class has at least three enharmonic equivalents when using the
five most common accidentals: \emph{naturals, flats, sharps, double-flats, and
double-sharps}. (The remaining pitch class only has two possible enharmonic
equivalents without creating accidentals that exist only in theory such as
triple-sharps or triple-flats.)

\hypertarget{goals-for-this-topic-8}{%
\subsection{Goals for this topic}\label{goals-for-this-topic-8}}

In the example below, each measure contains two notes that are enharmonically
equivalent. Using this example, determine: - up to three \emph{enharmonic
equivalents} for every \emph{pitch class} using flats, sharps, double sharps,
and double flats. - Which one of the \emph{pitch classes} only has two
enharmonic equivalents when using the five most common accidentals?

\hypertarget{conclusion-16}{%
\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-16}}

Using the example above, you can extrapolate which pitch classes have three
enharmonic equivalents and which have two.

Two examples of complete enharmonic equivalent groups would be: - A,
B-double-flat, G-double-sharp - B, C-flat, A-double-sharp

Each pitch in these groups belong to the same pitch class, because they share
an identical frequency. Yet they function differently within the context of
music, so we have multiple ways of labeling the same frequency.

This shows that the \emph{letter} system employed in staff notation is the
limiting factor in creating enharmonic equivalents within a pitch class. The
pitch class that includes A-flat is isolated from its neighbors in such a way
that there is no pitch that uses the letter \emph{F} or \emph{B} to create a
third enharmonic equivalent when using only the five common accidentals. The
interaction between the 7 letter names and 12 pitch classes is the basis for
our musical notation system and will be critical in how we label intervals,
chords, and scales.

When labeling pitches, we also need a way to refer to specific octaves or

\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-36}}

There are a few simple rules to label octaves using the ISO system. - Notes
are labeled using a pitch name and a number. - The numbers represent an octave
range and higher numbers equate to higher octaves. - Each numbered octave
starts on C, not A. - Each number ends on B. - Even if two notes are
enharmonically equivalent, they can have different octave designations. For
example, C-flat4 and B3 are enharmonically equivalent, but because they
straddle the octave break between C and B, they are labeled as belonging to
different octaves.

You were told that C4 is \emph{middle C}, and from this, you should be able to
determine where \emph{middle C} appears on each clef

From this, it is easy to see the necessity of clefs. Ledger lines are an
important notation tool, but too many ledger lines becomes difficult to read
quickly. Therefore, each clef highlights a specific range that can be written
without employing ledger lines. Alto clef is typically thought of as a lower
extension for treble clef; it adds the visual space of seven steps from treble
clef. Tenor clef is a higher extension for bass clef and adds the visual space
of five steps from bass clef. Of course, alto and tenor clef have similar
ranges and one of the other could likely be eliminated with little issue --
alto clef is visually seven steps from either treble or bass clef -- but
because both of these clefs have been widely used for more than a century, it
is necessary for all musicians to be familiar with reading them.

This is almost entirely related to the evolution of the musical notation
system and how the non-accidental pitches (i.e.~``white keys'' of the
keyboard) form a major scale. While this is a fascinating topic, it is
somewhat beyond the purview of this chapter, but I hope you will explore this
further on your own.

As you listen through all of the examples below, you should: - figure out why
\emph{natural, melodic,} and \emph{harmonic} minors are named as they are - be
able to describe how \emph{modes} relate to the major and minor scales (or
vice versa) - describe which modes seem ``light'' and ``dark'' and what seems
to create this phenomenon - discuss how major and minor \emph{pentatonic}
scales relate to the major and minor scales - memorize the names for each
scale degree (i.e.~tonic) as well as the corresponding numeral notation - how
the names for each scale degree are derived (e.g.~How are dominant and
subdominant scale degrees related?) - incorporate the Latin spelling for every
solfege

\hypertarget{modes}{%
\section{Modes}\label{modes}}

The next eight scales are all modal scales, and the first six of these modes
actually pre-date the major and minor scales. Even though you are likely more
familiar with major and minor scales to this point in your musical education,
modes are commonly used in all types of Western music, including classical,
jazz, pop, movie soundtracks, and folk music. As you listen to Happy Birthday
played in each mode, take note of the basic structure of each mode by
comparing how they are related to the major and minor scales. Is there an easy
way to remember these?

Each mode can be ``ranked'' on a scale from the darkest to lightest sound, so
on your first listen, take note of which sound dark and light to you.
(Remember that describing a scale as light or dark is a somewhat subjective
concept, so take your ranking with a grain of salt.) Once you have them
grouped dark and light modes, see if you can figure out what each group has in
common. Does there seem to be a pattern of notes that pushes a mode toward the
extremes of your rankings?

Because we have yet to discuss tonality as a concept, you do not need to worry
too much about the difference between modal and diatonic (i.e.~major and
minor) music yet. So as you listen to the modes below, simply compare the
intervallic patterns and solfege to that of the major and minor scales above.
We will discuss their usage more as we begin to explore musical function and
harmony in later chapters.

\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-17}}

When first studying the modes, most students consider modes a simple extension
of their major scale--i.e.~``Phrygian mode is a major scale starting on the
third scale degree''--even though the primary six modes (Ionian through
Aeolian) predate the major scale. Relating the modes to the major scale is a
good way to memorize their construction, because many major scales are widely
taught as the foundation of Western music. Eventually, you should strive to be
able to recall each mode as its own entity, so that you can begin hearing the
intracacies of how the mode functions musically, rather than hearing it as an
derivative of the major scale.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llllllll@{}}
\toprule
Modes from C Ionian & \^{}1 & \^{}2 & \^{}3 & \^{}4 & \^{}5 & \^{}6 & \^{}7 \\

Locrian & B & C & D & E & F & G & A \\
Lydian Dominant & F & G & A & B & C & D & Eb \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Of course, there are other ways to memorize these. The most obvious is to
memorize the intervallic pattern from the tonic note. The table below shows
the intervals necessary to reach the next scale degree of each mode.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llllllll@{}}
\toprule

You may prefer to remember the relationship of \emph{scale degrees} to the
Ionian mode--much as you derive the minor scale through raising and lowering
pitches--rather than relating the entirety of the scale to its Ionian mode.

Yet understanding construction does nothing to further your understanding of
their function. We often associate modes with early music, but as mentioned
above, modal music is still common in many types of modern music. Using modes
allows composers to create a range of colors, through a variety of techniques.
For example, one popular theory ranks the modes from ``light'' to ``dark''
based on the number of raised or lowered pitches in the mode. If you apply
this logic to the previous table, you can see that Lydian and Ionian would be
the ``brightest'' modes because they have the most raised pitches, whereas
Phrygian and Locrian would be the darkest modes because they have the most
lowered pitches respectively.

Our ``non-mode''--the Lydian Dominant scale--shares the altered pitches from
both the Lydian and Mixolydian modes, so it cannot be derived in the same
manner as the other modes. It is, however, useful in improvising over dominant
seventh chords and has the unusual characteristic of acting as a hybrid of the
whole tone and octatonic scales, two non-diatonic scales that we will discuss
in Unit 22. After you read more about those two scales at a later date, return
to the Lydian Dominant scale to see if you can determine \emph{why} we
consider it a hybrid of a whole tone and octatonic collections.

You should spend time exploring each of these modes to learn why one pitch can
sound ``tonicized'' without a traditional dominant to tonic relationship. With
very few exceptions, every piece of music contains a harmonic method for
creating tension and release, and music written in these modes is no
different. When listening to all of the versions of \emph{Happy Birthday}
above, you probably disliked the first time a mode landed on \texttt{te}, but
after listening to multiple examples using \texttt{te}, it becomes normalized
and can be heard as a weaker--but still functional--counterpart to
\texttt{do}. Discovering how each mode creates tension and release is
paramount to understanding modal usage, and will help you create a framework
for any scale--including those below.

\hypertarget{basic-pentatonic-scales}{%
\section{Basic pentatonic scales}\label{basic-pentatonic-scales}}

We will discuss the pentatonic scales here because of their importance and
prevalence in a variety of music, but these are not a complete modal shift
from major and minor scales in the way that the modes are. Instead, certain
the penatonic scales exclude certain pitches when compared to the parallel
major or minor scale, which makes them easily related but functionally
different. You will see this in the examples below, because it required some
``artistic license'' to translate a tune based in the major scale into a
pentatonic collection.

\hypertarget{conclusions-37}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-37}}

The pentatonic scale is a nearly universal sonority as demonstrated by Bobby
McFerrin in the following clip.

Neither the major or minor form of the pentatonic scale relates strongly to
the harmonic functions that we will study in this course, but their prominence
in world and folk musics makes them an important part of our musical heritage.
This alone justifies familarity with these colors.

Major and minor pentatonic scales have a simple relationship to their major
and minor counterparts. The major pentatonic scale uses the first, second,
third, fifth, and sixth scale degrees of the major scale. The minor pentatonic
scale uses the first, third, fourth, fifth, and seventh scale degrees of the
minor scale.

Even though they do not function diatonically, there are two general concepts
of harmony in pentatonic scales. 1. The tonic and dominant scale degrees still
function as the primary harmonic ``poles'' in a pentatonic scale. 2. The lack
of a leading tone in both forms is the primary reason that these do not
function similarly to diatonic harmony. That being said, \texttt{la} in major
pentatonic scales and \texttt{te} in minor pentatonic scales can take on a
similar function by pulling toward the tonic in a melody.

\section{Chromatic scale}\label{chromatic-scale}}

This final example is a heavily ornamented version of \emph{Happy Birthday}
that demonstrates every possible solfege as well as the correct resolution for
all chromatic tones. This arrangement is still technically in G major, because
strictly speaking, the chromatic scale is a collection of pitches and does not
necessarily center around one tone. (Note that because ABC notation has no way
to represent scale degrees, I was forced to omit the \texttt{\^{}} that would
normally appear above each scale degree and to use a \texttt{b} to represent a
flat and a \texttt{\#} to represent a sharp. Please forgive the misuses.)

\hypertarget{conclusions-38}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-38}}

The chromatic scale is not a tonality, because it has no tonic. It is however,
the aggregate pitch collection and functions as a useful way to familiarize a
musician with all twelve pitch-classes.

The final ``Happy Birthday'' version above uses every possible scale degree in
order to demonstrate resolution in a diatonic key, but it is not a
``chromatic'' tonality. That example is still in G major, but it is heavily
embellished using chromatic tones.

Of particular note, the example demonstrates the importance of considering
resolution when choosing which chromatic pitch to use. Generally, if a pitch
is raised, it should resolve upward; if a pitch is lowered, it should resolve
downward. For example, \texttt{li} and \texttt{te} are enharmonically
equivalent, but they function differently because their accidentals imply
specific resolutions. \texttt{Li} should resolve to \texttt{ti}, but
\texttt{te} should resolve to \texttt{la}. This is not only important in
simplifying notation for harmonic analysis, but it also makes it easier for
performers when reading heavily chromatic music.

\emph{NOTE: The full descriptions below of each type of non-chord tone are

\hypertarget{non-chord-tone-recap}{%
\section{Non-chord tone recap}\label{non-chord-tone-recap}}

Understanding non-chord tones is critical for increasing the accuracy and
speed of your tonal analysis. When looking at pieces of music, specifically
those that have complicated textures, you will often face difficult decisions
about which tones are functional to the harmonic progression and which tones
are embellishing those functional tones. If you know the shapes that chord
tones and their embellishments form, you can separate chord tones from
embellishments by simply looking for common patterns.

\textbf{We will use the same simple progression that we used in the previous
topic as a template for demonstrating non-chord tones. If you do not still
have this analyzed, you may wish to do so again before proceeding.}

Once you have a working definition, see if the other other descriptors
(e.g.~upper/lower, ascending/descending, chromatic/diatonic,
on-chord/off-chord, or accented/non-accented) can be applied to each NCT.

\includegraphics{/images/embellishingTones/doubleNeighbor.png}

Like neighbor tones, a \emph{neighbor group}, also known as a double neighbor
figure, begins and ends on the \emph{same} stable tone. Between those two
instances of the stable tone are two embellishing tones --- one a step above
and the other a step below the stable tone being embellished. Though
individually we may consider each of the two embellishing tones to be
incomplete neighbor tones, working together in the double-neighbor figure,
they balance each other and create a contiguous whole, with the overall
stability of a complete neighbor. A double neighbor figure is typically
unaccented and off-chord, although it could be both accented and on-chord.

\includegraphics{images/embellishingTones/appoggiatura.png}

An appoggiatura is a kind of incomplete neighbor tone that is \emph{approached
by leap, and followed by step in the opposite direction}.

\includegraphics{images/embellishingTones/escapeTone.png}

An escape tone, or \emph{echappée}, is \emph{approached by stepwise motion and
left by leap in the opposite direction}.

The term ``figure'' can be used when discussing non-chord tones to imply that
the melody follows the \emph{shape} of a particular non-chord tone, but all
pitches are actually chord tones. This is very useful in describing melodic
shapes. (e.g.~A melody can be described as having a passing tone figure if the
melody has a stepwise movement continuously in one direction, even if every
note belongs to a chord.)

\includegraphics{images/embellishingTones/anticipation.png}

An anticipation is essentially an otherwise stable tone that comes too early.
An anticipation is a non-chord tone that will occur immediately before a
change of harmony, and it will be followed on that change of harmony by the
same note, now a chord tone of the new harmony. Therefore, it is approached by
stepwise motion and left by static motion. The static motion between the NCT
and its resolution means that you may consider this related to both
suspensions and retardations, although unlike suspensions and retardations,
this is an unaccented, off-chord NCT with static motion occurring \emph{after}
the NCT rather than before. It is typically found at the ends of phrases and
larger formal units.

Some theorists classify syncopated rhythmic figures as separate from
anticipations, but this is more a discussion of re-articulation. For those
that classify these differently,
\href{http://openmusictheory.com/syncopation.html}{syncopation} occurs when a
rhythmic pattern that typically occurs on strong beats or strong parts of the
beat occurs instead on weak beats or weak parts of the beat. Like the
anticipation, the syncopated note is an early arrival --- it tends to belong
to the chord on the following beat. Unlike the anticipation, the syncopation
is tied into a note in that chord and is not rearticulated. Rather than
anticipating a note in the chord that follows, a syncopation is simply a
disjointed and repeated arrival of the chord itself. Of course, you should
consider context when making this decision as this difference is subtle, but
if there is a pattern of syncopated rhythms in a passage, you could be more
likely to label syncopation for the passage as a whole, rather than many
anticpations.

\textbf{Pedals, often referred to as pedal points, most often occur in the
bass voice but can occur in any voice. They can be difficult to spot if the
texture is broken into arpeggiated chords, so it may be necessary to reduce a
complicated texture down to block chords to more easily find the pedals.}

\subsubsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-42}}

Pedals are \emph{approached by static motion and left by static motion};
essentially, this is just a pitch that refuses to leave regardless of whether
it belongs to the chord. Pedals are one of the most interesting non-chord
tones because they have a dual nature--they create some of the strongest
dissonances in tonal harmony, but their repetitive nature provides a sort of
strange stability. As a pedal continues, it will often alternate between
acting as a chord tone and non-chord tone, so it can be helpful to label the
chord tones as ``pedal figures'' to show the continuation of the pedal.

\hypertarget{incomplete-neighbor-tone-int}{%
\subsection{Incomplete Neighbor Tone
(INT)}\label{incomplete-neighbor-tone-int}}

It is uncommon, but you will occasionally encounter an unaccented non-chord
tone that is approached by leap and left in the \emph{same} direction;
resembling an appoggiatura but not resolving in the opposite direction. For
this course, we will label these as \emph{incomplete neighbor tones}, although
some theorists use this term to refer to appoggiaturas and escape tones as
well. Broadly speaking, you should not resort to an incomplete neighbor tone
NCT unless you have exhausted all other options, because it is far more likely
for this shape is part of a chordal skip rather than an NCT.

\hypertarget{part-writing}{%
\section{Part-writing}\label{part-writing}}

The term \emph{part-writing} can imply many things depending on its context,
but for our purposes, this will be our first attempt to combine the
fundamentals of melody (counterpoint) and harmony (voice-leading from
circle-of-fifths progressions) into functional music using diatonic tonality.

By applying the various rules and techniques that we have studied thus far, we
will be able to: - Harmonize a melody - Compose a melody given a harmony -
Fully voice four-part harmonies - Create independent melodic lines that
function harmonically together

Units 10 and 11 will help you solidify this process. First, we will establish
a reference model by looking at the rules--and resulting errors from breaking
those rules--that occur when writing in a four-part chorale style. We will
then apply these guidelines to our own attempts to compose basic four-part
chorales in order to better understand the voice-leading principles of
diatonic music.

We will be referring to this handout,
\href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s9Xd3LPqoaEevshTopxHzLX9jCzxVCZocOBLD_dceMU/edit?usp=sharing}{Part-Writing
Error Checklist and Guide}, for the next two units, so you may want to print
this out or open it in a separate window.

\hypertarget{why-part-writing}{%
\section{Why part-writing?}\label{why-part-writing}}

Before we begin, I would like to address a question that I have received many
times from students. Why do we study part-writing rather than just analysis,
particularly in a strict style that is not performed regularly by modern
musicians?

There are many answers for this, but there is one in particular that I think
justifies the study of this in this course. Part-writing is the simplest way
to study \emph{how} voice-leading creates harmony. Even though most of its
rules are archaic, and a modern student's ear is not nearly as offended by
certain style characteristics (e.g.~parallel perfect fifths), this is the most
direct way to study every aspect of how music functions: voice-leading, chord
progressions, voicing chords, chordal structure, tendency tones, melodic
construction, and so on.

We could attempt to focus on only one style of modern music--whether pop,
jazz, classical, or otherwise--but because each is a fully developed, complex
language, you would still need to learn basic harmonic movement before
beginning to write in that style. And because each of these musics has its
roots in diatonic harmony, an understanding of basic chorale style
part-writing will allow you to study and develop a process to analyze
\emph{all} of these styles, rather than focusing your studies into only one
area and being ignorant of the others.

In short, focus on the \emph{process} of the part-writing rather than trying
to memorize every rule as if it is unbreakable. Even within a style, rules are
guidelines, so an inflexible mindset will lead to nothing but frustration.
Once you have grasped the basics of part-writing, you will have advanced
another step toward the goal of improving your musicianship.

\hypertarget{traditional-errors}{%
\section{Traditional errors}\label{traditional-errors}}

In the last \href{10-intro-harmonic/a1-voiceleadingerrors.html}{topic}, we
first looked at some basic rules for voicing a chord in a four-part chorale
style. These rules included: - Voice-crossing - In this style, voices
generally should not cross - Exception: alto and tenor may cross briefly if
musically necessary - Spacing - In this style, the top three voices--soprano,
alto, and tenor--should always be within an octave of the adjacent voices. To
be more specific, there can never be more than an octave between
\emph{soprano} and \emph{alto}, and there can never be more than an octave
bteween \emph{alto} and \emph{tenor}. - There \textbf{can} be more than an
octave between \emph{bass} and \emph{tenor}. - There \textbf{can} be more than
an octave between \emph{soprano} and \emph{tenor}, and this creates two
different types of voicings. - A \emph{closed voicing} has \textbf{less} than
an octave between \emph{soprano} and \emph{tenor}. - An \emph{open voicing}
has \textbf{more} than an octave between \emph{soprano} and \emph{tenor}. -
Range - Each part must stay within the typical range for that
voice/instrument? - Doubling - You can double the root of a chord when
possible. - For triads, you may double the fifth instead of the root if
necessary. - This is actually more preferable if the triad is in second
inversion. - \textbf{Do not} double the third because it is a tendency tone.
If this is doubled, it will force you to choose between the incorrect
resolution of a tendency tone or unacceptable parallel octaves. Also, the
third should also be least present chord tone in the balance for the chord to
sound best. - \textbf{Do not} double the seventh because it is a tendency
tone. If this is doubled, it will force you to choose between the incorrect
resolution of a tendency tone or unacceptable parallel octaves. - \textbf{Do
not} double the fifth of a seventh chord. This would require omitting the
root, third, or seventh, and none of these are expendable.

\hypertarget{part-writing-errors}{%
\section{Part-writing errors}\label{part-writing-errors}}

In addition to the voicing rules, there are a number of standard part-writing
errors that should be avoided as well: 1. Parallel perfect octaves or perfect
fifths 2. Similar octaves or fifths (sometimes referred to as ``direct,''
``hidden,'' or ``exposed'') 3. Unacceptable unequal fifths 4. Contrary perfect
octaves or perfect fifths

Please note that these errors \emph{must be within the same two voices} across
both chords. Due to the effects of consistently doubling roots, there will
almost always be consecutive perfect octaves and perfect fifths between two
triads, but this is not \emph{parallel}. For example, a root position C major
triad moving to a root position G triad likely will have two voices on C in
the first chord and two voices on G in the second chord, if standard doubling
practices are observed. This is fine as long as its not in the \emph{same} two
voices in both chords (e.g.~soprano and bass both have C and then both have a
G).

Each of the four primary categories of part-writing errors are \emph{symptoms}
of voice-leading issues. If you understand the underlying voice-leading issues
of each of these errors, you can find them more easily and avoid them in your
own part-writing.

\textbf{Once you are comfortable with the descriptions of each of the errors
below, try to fix each of the errors using the interface. What do you have to
change? Do you have to alter the harmony? Voice-leading? Voicing? In trying to
fix it, do you just create further errors?}

\section{Parallel perfect fifths and perfect octaves (PP5,
PP8)}\label{parallel-perfect-fifths-and-perfect-octaves-pp5-pp8}}

Part-writing errors result from poor voice-leading. For example, look at the
progression below and try to find our first major error: \emph{parallel
perfect octaves} (PP8). Once you have found it, look to see if a voicing rule
(e.g.~spacing, doubling, etc.) has been broken. If the voicing error is not
fixed, is there any way to avoid the parallel octaves without incorrectly
resolving a tendency tone?

to the example again. Do you have a difficult time differentiating the upper
voice from the lower of these two voices?

\hypertarget{conclusions-43}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-43}}

PP8 and PP5 undermine the independence of lines, so you should always avoid
them in this style. Unacceptable parallel fifths and octaves occur when two
voices have consecutive perfect fifths/octaves and move in parallel motion. It
is not parallel perfect fifths/octaves if the intervals change voices.
(e.g.~The first P8/P5 is between the soprano and tenor, but the second P8/P5
is between the soprano and alto.)

In the first example, there are two examples of parallel perfect octaves: -
between the soprano and tenor moving from ii6 to V7 - between the soprano and
tenor moving from V7 to I

There is a larger underlying issue, however, because a doubling rule was
broken on the V7. Because the third was doubled, you are forced to choose
between incorrectly resolving one of the leading tones or undermining the
independence of the two voices by locking them into consecutive perfect
octaves.

Parallel perfect fifths and octaves undermine the independence of the
individual voices. If you repeatedly listen to the the PP5 example repeatedly,
you will find it difficult to distinguish the tenor voice from the bass voice.
This effect would be even more pronounced if the chords were tuned using just
intonation, because the upper note will blend into the overtone series of the
lower note.

In summary, you may never have parallel perfect octaves or parallel perfect
fifths in this style of music. Please note that for an interval to be
considered \emph{parallel}, the interval must occur consecutively in the
\emph{same} two voices. For example, if your first P8 is between the bass and
alto, the second P8 must also be in the bass and alto. If you find a P8
between the bass and tenor on the second chord, this is acceptable because it
does not undermine the independence of the voices.

Our next part-writing error, \emph{contrary perfect fifths} and \emph{contrary
perfect octaves} (CP5 or CP8) are simply an attempt to cover up parallel
perfect fifths and parallel perfect octaves by displacing one voice by an
octave. The next two examples attempt to fix the errors from the first two
examples on this page by displacing one voice of the parallel perfect
intervals. Identify these by comparing them to the previous example (i.e.~P)

In the first example, there are two examples of parallel perfect octaves: -

tenor moving from V7 to I

In the second example above, the CP5s occur between bass and tenor voices
between: - the I chord and ii chord - the ii chord and the V7 chord

Contrary perfect 5ths/8ves occur when two voices have consecutive perfect
fifths/octaves and move in contrary motion. Contrary fifths and octaves occur
when trying to mask parallel perfect fifths and octaves, so they will exhibit
most of the traits of PP5/PP8 including the fact that the intervals must occur
between the same two voices If the interval changes voices, it does not
undermine the independence of the voices.

\hypertarget{unacceptable-unequal-fifths-uu5}{%
\section{Unacceptable unequal fifths
(UU5)}\label{unacceptable-unequal-fifths-uu5}}

The last two common part-writing errors have specific clauses tied to them
that specify which voices are acceptable and unacceptable. The first,
\emph{unacceptable unequal fifths} (UU5), must occur between the bass voice
and one of the upper voices. In the following example, find the
\emph{unacceptable unequal fifths} where a d5 moves to a P5. What is wrong
with the voice-leading here?

\hypertarget{conclusions-45}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-45}}

Unacceptable unequal fifths are one of the easier part-writing errors to
understand, because we are actually focusing on only one voice-leading issue.
And because it is limited to certain voices, it is relatively easy to find
compared to parallel and contrary fifths/octaves which are not acceptable
between any voices.

For this course, we will consider a d5 moving to a P5 \emph{unacceptable}
unequal fifths, but we will consider a P5 moving to a d5 as
\emph{acceptable}--a P5 to a d5 does not require poor resolutions of tendency
tones. Remember that these errors are best thought of as symptoms of the
actual problem. In this case, the real issue is that the only two notes in a
diatonic key that can form a d5 are \texttt{ti} and \texttt{fa}, and as
discussed many times in this course, these two notes imply a dominant harmony
that wants to resolve inward with \texttt{ti} moving to \texttt{do} and
\texttt{fa} moving to \texttt{mi}. For a d5 to be followed by a P5, it would
mean that \texttt{fa} must resolve to \texttt{sol}--or less commonly,
\texttt{ti} resolving to \texttt{la} as part of a deceptive progression--which
is poor voice-leading and therefore the error we are trying to avoid. There
are some stricter versions of chorale part-writing that do not allow any form
of unequal fifths.

\hypertarget{unacceptable-similar-fifths-or-octaves-us5-us8}{%
\section{Unacceptable similar fifths or octaves (US5,
US8)}\label{unacceptable-similar-fifths-or-octaves-us5-us8}}

The final common part-writing has many names, but we will use the term
\emph{unacceptable similar fifths or octaves}. The term \emph{similar} can
also be replaced with ``direct,'' ``hidden,'' or ``exposed.'' I prefer the
term \emph{similar} because it describes the motion like the other categories,
but I also think that \emph{exposed} does a fine job describing the effect. (I
dislike the term \emph{hidden} because students often confuse this with
contrary fifths (or octaves), because the goal of contrary fifths is to
``hide'' parallel fifths.) \emph{Unacceptable similar fifths or octaves} have
the most restrictions. The conditions are: - They can only occur between the
soprano and the bass voices. - They require a skip of a third or more in the
soprano voice. - The two voices must move in similar (not parallel) motion. -
The second interval must be a P5 or P8.

If any one of these conditions are \emph{not} met, then this error does not
exist in that case. Look at the following example to find an example of
\emph{similar octaves}. Once you have found it, look at the voice-leading
around it. What does it do to spacing? Does it create more errors?
Unacceptable similar octaves and fifths also often create melodies that imply
different harmonies. To demonstrate, sing the melody alone. Do you hear it as
C major or a different key?

Similar fifths/octaves occur when 1) the soprano and bass voices 2) move in
similar motion to a 3) perfect fifth/octave, and 4) the soprano voice has a
skip of a third or larger. You can see an example of this between the first
two chords in this example.

Similar fifths/octaves are sometimes called ``exposed'' fifths/octaves, and
both of these terms demonstrate a key feature about the part-writing error.
Obviously, they must move in similar motion, but the term ``exposed''
highlights the fact that these must occur between the outer voices. By having
similar motion to a perfect interval in the outer voices, it creates the
impression of a parallel perfect interval. Most importantly, the leap in the
soprano typically creates a poor soprano line in which the melody
outlines/implies an unintentional harmony. In the example above, if you sing
the melody line without the harmony it outlines A minor instead of C major.

When one begins reading transposed scores, it can be daunting to try to
process the information, however, the best score readers are able to mentally
``condense'' the information into a score that contains all of the important
parts to make sense of the most important information. To practice this, we
will continue using simple four-part chorales. While a complete score in most
styles will be considerably more complex, a chorale will allow you to practice
the transpositions and then use your analysis skills to make sure that your
transpositions worked correctly.

\hypertarget{examples-1}{%

Practice your transposition on the following two examples by condensing the
top four voices into an SATB score on the grand staff at the bottom two
staves. Each upper voice is written in the standard transposition for the

concert pitch before placing it on the grand staff. You may want to open Unit

The prototypical sentence is eight measures long and contains two four-measure
phrases. The first of these is called the \emph{presentation phrase} and the
second is the \emph{continuation phrase}.

\hypertarget{presentation-phrase-mm.-14}{%
\subsubsection{Presentation phrase (mm.
1--4)}\label{presentation-phrase-mm.-14}}

The presentation phrase begins the sentence and has two primary components,
one melodic and the other harmonic. Melodically, it contains two repeated
\emph{basic ideas} (BI). Harmonically, it prolongs the tonic, by means of
either a
\href{harmonicSyntax2.html\#subsidiary-harmonic-progressions\%22}{subsidiary
harmonic progression} or
\href{harmonicSyntax2.html\#contrapuntal-prolongation--passing-chord}{contrapuntal
chords}.

Presentation: Mozart, K. 283, i., mm. 1--4

Here, the basic idea begins with the pickup to m. 1 and ends with the F-sharp
on the downbeat of m. 2. It's then repeated. Though a basic idea is often
exactly repeated, this example shows that it need not be. Rather, a basic idea
is defined more abstractly by its rhythm and melodic contour, and thus, varied
repetitions like this are possible.

Harmonically, these four measures prolong tonic. Measures two and three are
contrapuntal chords that are surrounded by the tonic:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{I V4/3 V6/5 I}\\
or\\
\textbf{T(1 D(2 7)n 1)}
\end{quote}

Altogether, the two expressions of the basic idea and the tonic prolongation
in this phrase exhibit
\href{themeFunctions.html\#presentation}{\emph{presentation function}}. Hence,
the name ``presentation phrase.''

\href{themeFunctions.html\#continuation-function}{\emph{continuation
function}}, which has one or more (but not necessarily all) of the following
five characteristics.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Fragmentation: a breakdown in the size of melodic units\\
\item
  Liquidation: removal of ``characteristic'' melodic figures\\
\item
  Sequential repetition
\item
  Accelerated surface rhythm\\
\item
  Accelerated harmonic rhythm
\end{itemize}

Presentation + Continuation: Mozart, K. 283, I, mm. 1--10

This example exhibits all five characteristics. The basic idea creates a
normative unit that is two measures in length. Beginning with the pickup to m.
5, that normative size is \emph{fragmented} into one-measure units whose
second half is \emph{sequenced} one step lower. At m. 7 \emph{increased
surface rhythm} is matched with an \emph{acceleration of harmonic rhythm} as
the pianist's sixteenth notes occur above a hemiola in the pianist's left
hand.

Sentences always end with cadential progressions that support
\href{themeFunctions.html\#cadential-function}{\emph{cadential function}}. In
this passage, while mm. 5--8 prolonged tonic by means of contrapuntal chords,
mm. 8--10 employ a typical cadential progression:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{I IV6 Cad.6/4 V7 I}\\
or\\
\textbf{T1 S6 D5 --- T1}
\end{quote}

And while mm. 5--8 employed fragments of the basic idea (the
``characteristic'' elements of the melody), mm. 8--10 \emph{liquidates} those
into elements unrelated to the basic idea (the ``conventional''
elements---scales and arpeggios, ending with a descending contour).

\hypertarget{phrase-length}{%
\subsubsection{Phrase length}\label{phrase-length}}

Note the length of the phrases in this example: a four-bar presentation phrase
is followed by a \emph{six-bar} continuation phrase. The prototypical phrase
is four measures, but this is commonly
\href{internalExpansions.html}{expanded} or even compressed by composers. In
the sentence, continuation phrases are more likely to undergo expansions or
contractions than are presentation phrases.

We can view the voicing rules (i.e.~spacing, range, doubling, and
voice-crossing) as our guidelines for creating the vertical aspect of this
style of music, and our voice-leading rules (i.e.~tendency tones, conjunct
lines, and avoiding part-writing errors) as guidelines for creating the
horizontal aspect of this style of music. By combining these ideas with a
general knowledge of diatonic chord progressions, we can begin composing our
first attempts at chorale-style music.

Before beginning, please remember that when composing in this style, you
occasionally will need to bend, or even break, these rules to accommodate
other musical goals. There is not a ``right'' or ``wrong'' hierarchy for the
conventional rules of part-writing. For example, you might choose to accept
parallel perfect 5ths if you are trying to create a particular melodic line
that emphasizes stepwise motion. Or, you might decide to use voice-crossing of
the inner voices to change the timbre and texture of a passage. So even the
cleverest of composers may choose to eschew convention if it does not align
with their musical goals, but for our beginning attempts, you should do your
best to observe every rule in order to understand their importance and
implementation.

\hypertarget{reviewing-our-part-writing-process}{%
\section{Reviewing our part-writing
process}\label{reviewing-our-part-writing-process}}

In \href{11-further-part-writing/a1-funds-of-part-writing.html}{Unit 11a}, we
outlined a method for harmonizing a melody: 1. Identify the key 2. Determine
your phrase 3. Choose a cadence to complete your phrase. 4. Create the rest of
the diatonic progression beginning on tonic and ending with your cadence. 5.
Compose a bass line based on your harmonization. 6. Fill in the alto and tenor
voices.

And we employed the stylistic guidelines that we studied in Unit 10 to act as
the framework for our part-writeing. - follow the standard harmonic
progressions outlined by circle-of-fifths progressions - correctly use
cadences - use functions such as tonic, dominant, and pre-dominant as general
guides - employ the smoothest possible voice-leading for each line - The bass
can be slightly more disjunct than the upper parts, particularly when using
root-position chords. - do not cross voices - avoid spacing or range errors -
avoid incorrect doubling - resolve tendency tones correctly - avoid
unacceptable part-writing such as parallel perfect 5ths/8ves, contrary perfect
5ths/8ves, similar 5ths/8ves, and unequal 5ths

Remember that circle-of-fifths progressions work because the voice-leading
taps into the primary functions of diatonic harmony. If you review
\href{07-harmonic-functions/a1-diaprogcirclefifths.html}{Unit 7a}, you will
remember that we created the harmonic flow chart by simply following good
voice-leading between chords that have roots separated by a descending
P5/ascending P4. Admittedly, long strings of root-position chords create
unmelodic bass lines, but they still represent the strongest voicing for many
sonorities.

\hypertarget{getting-started}{%
\section{Getting started}\label{getting-started}}

To give you a chance to create all four voices, we will now compose a
four-part chorale using a circle-of-fifths progression. Because you now have
harmonies and a bass line composed for you, you can use the same process as
above but replace steps 3 and 4 (and 5 if given a pre-determined bass line
from the harmony): - \textbf{Write a simple melody (soprano line)} - Use
mostly stepwise motion. - A good phrase will have an overall arc (upward or
downward) with only one climax. - Leaps of a fourth or more should resolve by
stepwise motion in the opposite direction.

Try to create a clean and simple texture. Write the soprano line from the
given first pitch, and then fill in the inner voices following the guidelines
above.

After you have completed your harmonization, make sure to double-check it for
part-writing errors. If you feel good about your attempt, try changing your
melody and trying again.

\hypertarget{conclusion-18}{%
\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-18}}

After attempting this for the first time, most students are surprised at how
relatively simple this process is once you get started. Your first
harmonization from above was probably similar to this:

Because the chord progression provides a vertical framework and the focus on
smooth voice-leading provides a horizontal framework, most of the process is
simply following a pattern. This example is admittedly straightforward,
because it relies entirely on root-position triads in a circle-of-fifths
progression.

\hypertarget{adding-the-seventh}{%
\section{Adding the seventh}\label{adding-the-seventh}}

In studying music theory, we will often spend more time discussing the
exceptions to rules than the actual rule itself. And even though the general
rule for resolving chordal sevenths--\emph{Chordal sevenths resolve down by
step}--is fairly consistent, there are common situtations in which you will be
forced to break this rule (e.g.~pre-determined melodies, sequences, etc.) Make
downward stepwise resolution your default until you are forced to choose
otherwise.

Try adding the following two seventh chords to our circle-of-fifths
progression, making sure to pay attention to how your chordal thirds and
sevenths are resolving. The first chord is fully voiced to force you into
certain decisions, so you will need to start from the beginning rather than
working your way backward.

\hypertarget{conclusion-19}{%
\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-19}}

The addition of seventh chords create problems to solve as you now must
contend with additional tendency tones. The first arises between the second
and third chords. If you simply choose the smoothest voice-leading possible
for each voice going into the second chord, vi7, you will place the chordal
seventh in the tenor voice. This locks the voice-leading of the tenor voice
into resolving downward by step to the third of the following ii chord, and in
turn, that chordal third has its own tendencies and should resolve upward by
step to the the root of the next chord. This means that the initial placement
on the vi7 effectively locks the entire tenor voice into place. From there,
our alto voice is predetermined, because we do not want to double the third of
the ii chord, leaving us with only the closest D or A. If we were to move to
the A, that would create parallel perfect 5ths with the bass voice, so we can
only choose the D for the alto voice. To move to the next chord, if we do not
alter our soprano voice, we are then forced to place a B in the tenor voice
which creates a less melodic tenor line.

While this works, it leaves many strange voicings, such as the tripled roots
of the ii and I chords as well as the unmelodic tenor line. There is a simpler
option. It is easier to have the alto voice jump slightly to the the chordal
seventh on the vi7 which leads to the following progression.

Notice that the chordal third in the alto voice of the ii chord defies its
tendency to resolve upwards to the root, and instead, uses static motion to
become the chordal seventh of the V7. This is our first example of having to
make a choice between two guidelines; is it better to prioritize smooth part
writing or tendency tone resolution. In this case, the smooth voice-leading
creates a stronger overall texture, so I prefer that option. You could,
however, prefer the other sound and prioritize your tendency tones.

\hypertarget{exploring-options}{%

Of course, there are multiple chords in our circle-of-fifths progressions that
have root movement by intervals other than 4ths and 5ths. Try harmonizing the
following short chord progressions while observing our guidelines. Keep track
of what types of root movement create the most issues while developing at
least two possibilities for each of the progressions.

\hypertarget{conclusions-47}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-47}}

When you were harmonizing these short progressions, which chord progression
presented the most issues? For most, it will likely be when the progressions
that have root-movement by 2nd, particularly a progression like IV-V-vi. Let's
examine this by isolating a common example of this movement, V moving to vi.
In this progression, the V is acting according to its standard dominant
function, but the vi chord has replaced the I chord in the position where a
tonic chord usually appears. This progression represents a \emph{functional
substitution} in which vi is now acting as the tonic function. (This concept
has application within the dominant and pre-dominant functions as well, but we
need to explore first-inversion chords in the next topic, 11b, before we are
ready for that discussion)

\hypertarget{function-over-form-part-1}{%
\subsection{Function over Form (Part 1)}\label{function-over-form-part-1}}

A \emph{functional substitution} can, and often should, inform your
voice-leading. When a root-position V chord precedes a root-position vi chord,
we must choose to prioritize either our \emph{doubling} conventions or our
\emph{part-writing} conventions. More specifically, do we want to double the
third or do we want to end up with parallel perfect 8ves/5ths? We can
demonstrate this by looking at two nearly identical progressions. Harmonize
the following two progressions; first with the standard tonic function (i.e.~V
to I) and then with the functional substitution (i.e.~V to vi.) Even though
the I chord and vi chord have two common tones--the first and third scale
degrees--you will have to make very different choices to avoid voice leading
errors.

When attempting this deceptive cadence, you hopefully realized that you cannot
allow the tenor voice to remain on G and then resolve to A because it creates
parallel octaves with the bass voice. Because the vi chord acts as a
replacement for a I chord when it is part of a deceptive cadence, we double
the scale degree that works best for a I chord, \texttt{do}, rather than the
standard doubling of the root, \texttt{la} or fifth, \texttt{mi}. In this
progression, it is correct to break standard convention for doubling and
double the chordal third of the vi chord. This doubling should now be your
permanent convention for deceptive cadences. - When V goes to vi, the vi chord
is replacing the tonic function and therefore functions as a Isub6

So for the above example, a better approach would be to alter the melody to
allow for a doubling of the chordal third of the vi chord.

\subsection{Root movement by 2nd}\label{root-movement-by-2nd}}

The other difficult resolution in the previous example was when the root
position IV chord moved to the V chord. We do not have a \emph{functional
substitution} to provide a doubling exception here, so instead you must be
careful about how you resolve the voices. Harmonize the following progression
without altering the given pitches, and pay particular attention to the
direction that the upper voices resolve as you avoid part-writing errors.

\hypertarget{conclusion-20}{%
\subsubsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-20}}

Now that we are dealing with root movement of an interval other than a perfect
fourth, you cannot solely rely on simple voice leading guidelines such as
``chordal third moves upward by step to the root of the following chord.''
While this will still hold true when moving from V to I in this example, the
the IV and V chords are separated by a 2nd. So if you solely rely on smooth,
stepwise voice-leading, you will likely create objectionable parallel movement
between the two chords. For example, when composing he soprano line as you
move from the IV to the V chord, you cannot choose \texttt{re}, because this
creates parallel perfect 5ths against the bass. So you must choose to move to
the leading tone instead which locks your soprano line into
\texttt{C\ -\ C\ -\ B\ -\ C}. From there, you will have to use some small
skips in your other voices to resolve every voice in the smoothest possible
way. There are a few different options for this progression, but you likely
ended up with something like this.

\hypertarget{common-exceptions}{%
\section{Common exceptions}\label{common-exceptions}}

There are some commonly used exceptions to our general part-writing
conventions. For example, when a chord progression has a root that moves down
by P5, we expect the chordal third to resolve up by step to the root of the
following chord. However, if you need to change the texture of your
part-writing to be more or less compact, you may choose to have the chordal
third leap to the following chordal third which changes the entire voicing
possibilities of the two chords. (Note that you can only use this on the
leading tone if it is in an inner voice.) Use this method to fill in the inner
voices in the following example to change the voicing of the final chord.

\{\% capture ex6 \%\}X:6 T:Chordal third to chordal third M:4/4 L:1/4 Q:1/4=60

abc-example.html number=``6'' abc=ex6 \%\}

Another common exception is called the \emph{frustrated leading tone}. While
not considered ideal, you can choose to have the leading tone resolve by
skipping downward to the root of the tonic chord, \emph{if the leading-tone is
in an inner voice}. This can solve doubling issues if you are trying to fix an
incomplete triad by adding the chordal fifth. Try it in the tenor voice on the
following two progressions. Notice that this allows you to create a deceptive
cadence without having to double the chordal third of the vi chord.

\hypertarget{overall-conclusions-for-root-position-part-writing}{%
\section{Overall conclusions for root-position
part-writing}\label{overall-conclusions-for-root-position-part-writing}}

When first asked to compose a simple chorale, it is easy to feel paralyzed as
you consider all of the rules and guidelines that you have learned. Luckily,
if you develop an order to process the guidelines, they greatly simplify the
part-writing process. It is much simpler to write a melody when you only have
one or two options for the next pitch!

As stated above, you should use smooth voice-leading when possible, making it
a high priority in your decision-making process. But what constitutes
``smooth'' voice-leading? The simple answer is that stepwise, or sometimes
static, motion is preferred, although this is only one decision point to
consider. When you are creating a line, you will need to balance stepwise
motion against avoiding errors. For our simple chorale-style, we are not using
non-chord tones yet, so your next pitch must be a chord-tone. This means that
you must also consider the notes that are already present such as the bass
line or melody in order to ensure that you form a complete harmony and avoid
errors. When you add in doubling and range limitations, you can usually narrow
your options to one pitch.

You should also understand that while there are some general guidelines for
resolving tendency tones, there are no simple rules that are unbreakable. At
its most basic, \texttt{ti} resolves up by step, and \texttt{fa} resolves down
by step. When part-writing, however, this is too simplistic a view. For
example, \texttt{fa} often moves upward by step to \texttt{sol}, either as
part of an ascending scalar melodic line or in the bass line when a
pre-dominant chord (i.e.~IV or ii6 moves to a root-position V chord. A more
advanced part-writer may think that \texttt{ti} and \texttt{fa} are tendency
tones when they are part of a V7 chord, so therefore, the rule for tendency
tones should be that \emph{chordal thirds} resolve up by step and
\emph{chordal sevenths} resolve down by step. This is a better rule, but it
also falls apart when we leave circle-of-fifths progressions (chords with
roots separated by a descending P5). When a IV chord moves to a V chord, it is
impossible for the third to move \emph{up by step} to the root of the V chord.
For now, the easiest rule for tendency tones is: - \emph{Chordal thirds}
resolve up by step and \emph{chordal sevenths} resolve down by step \emph{when
part of a circle-of-fifths progression}.

\textbf{Pentatonic Scales Tricks}

-Take out the tri-tone notes (Degree 4 and 7) from the major scale for major
pentatonic.

-Minor pentatonic can be remembered as taking out scale degree 2 and 6.

-Major and Minor are the same pitches, but just organized in a different order
(different starting point). They are modes of each other.

\textbf{Bobby McFerrin Video}

He could demonstrate that the pentatonic scale can be used independently and
easily taught.

Even though it is missing the two notes that we considered important scale
degrees, if can still be expressive and interesting (and it is in our bones).

The chromatic scale consists entirely of half steps, and uses every pitch on

\textbf{Standard progressions using the bII} - You can spell this chord
enharmonically! We see this in the third mini-example within this example. The
Ab in the tenor is changed to a G\# in order to make the voice leading make
more sense--we go to an A next, so seeing a G\# is easier to read. - A doubled
third on a vii dim chord is common because the root and fifth are tendency
tones. - bII6 is going to be the most common version of this chord you see.
You can also write it as N6, but we suggest bII6 because that actually informs
its function (predominant, just like a regular ii!). - A root position bII
has\ldots problems. - We've introduced \emph{rah}, which wants to resolve down
because it's a flattened \emph{re}. So, when it's followed by a V(7), we
either have to have parallel octaves or have a tendency tone resolve in the
wrong direction (rah skipping down to ti or going up to re because there's no
doh in V. gross). - bII6 - iv sounds super cool! - There's only a half-step
difference which makes voice leading a dream (le down to sol). - bII6 in the
20th century starts to get weird, functionally. Mahler used it just as a
color. - bII6 is mode mixture: it's borrowed from Phrygian mode.

Lowest pitch=bass. Root is the chord that be build the thirds around.

\textbf{How do we determine seventh chord quality?}

The first letter gives the quality of the triad, while the second letter gives
the quality of the seventh. For example, Mm7 = a major triad + a minor
seventh.

Looking at both the triads in the seventh chord and be aware of the different
qualities they have.

Dominant and Dimished relationship: They both have diminished 5ths. Dominant
is between 3rd and 7th, while diminished is 1st and 5th (all chordal pitches).

\textbf{How do we determine and label seventh chord inversions?}

Seventh chords add third inversion because they have an additional note
compared to triads. Their inversion figures are as such: - Root position: 7 -
First inversion: 6/5 - Second inversion: 4/3 - Third inversion: 4/2

Remember to not add the slash when handwriting. Stacked things are just
impossible to notate online.

The inversions figures do not tell you the exact intervals and their qualities
above the bass. These are made to work with roman numberals.

A four-note chord whose pitch classes can be arranged as thirds is called a
\emph{seventh chord}.

Like with a triad, the pitch classes belonging to a seventh chord occupy
adjacent positions (a four-pitch-class clump) on the circle of thirds. The
four members of a seventh chord are the \emph{root}, \emph{third},
\emph{fifth}, and \emph{seventh}.

\caption{A seventh chord (A, C, E, G) on the diatonic circle of thirds.}
\end{figure}

There are five qualities of seventh chords that appear in diatonic music:
major seventh, dominant seventh, minor seventh, diminished seventh (also
called fully-diminished), and half-diminished seventh. They are comprised of
the following intervals above their roots:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  major seventh: M3, P5, and M7 above the root (or major triad with a major
  seventh)
\item
  dominant seventh: M3, P5, and m7 above the root (or major triad with a minor
  seventh)
\item
  minor seventh: m3, P5, and m7 above the root (or minor triad with a minor
  seventh)
\item
  diminished seventh: m3, d5, and d7 above the root (or diminished triad with
  a diminished seventh)
\item
  half-diminished seventh: m3, d5, and m7 above the root (or diminished triad
  with a minor seventh)
\end{itemize}

Following are the lead-sheet abbreviations for seventh-chord qualities:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  major seventh: maj7 or △7 (Gmaj7 or G△7)
\item
  dominant seventh: 7 (B7)
\item
  minor seventh: m7 (F♯m7)

Constructing a \emph{melodic line} and \emph{melodic intervals} - Length:
10-12 bars is average for 1:1 counterpoint, but the full range is 8-14 -
Starting and ending pitches: the tonic of whatever key we're in - Approaching
the final note: contrary stepwise motion. Ex: re in one voice and ti in
another, both will move to do - Repeated pitches, yay or nay? : NAY. You
cannot repeat pitches in your line - Melodic intervals: stepwise, skips, and
leaps are all ok! - How to approach and resolve leaps?: Approached and
followed by stepwise motion in the opposite direction of the leap. Ex: step
up, leap down, step up. Think of a sine wave! - Range: about an octave
\emph{or less}. It should be easily singable - Climax: happens on the highest
(or lowest) note, depending on how your counterpoint curves. There should only
be one highest/lowest note

Accpetable \emph{harmonic intervals} - Starting and ending harmonic
intervals?: P8 - Approaching perfect intervals: contrary motion - Number of
times an interval size can be used consecutively?: never more than 3 times in
a row. No consecutive perfect intervals

Accpetable \emph{motion between lines} - Acceptable types of motion: parallel,
similar, and contrary

Will there ever be oblique motion resulting from a cantus firmus with static
motion? - Not in what we'll be looking at in class, though some exception

\hypertarget{cantus-firmi}{%
\subsection{Cantus firmi}\label{cantus-firmi}}

A number of others are provided {[}here{]}{[}CFs{]}. Performing these is a
helpful practice to develop an internal sense of the sound and feel of a well
formed \emph{cantus}, and many of the characteristics of well formed
\emph{cantus firmi} carry over into other musical styles. (These model
\emph{cantus firmi} can also be used as the starting points for our two-voice
exercises.)

From these \emph{cantus}, notice how the general musical characteristics of
smoothness, melodic integrity, variety, and motion towards a goal are worked
out in specific characteristics. The following characteristics are typical of
all well formed \emph{cantus firmi}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  length of about 8--16 notes\\
\item
  arhythmic (all whole notes; no long or short notes)\\
\item
  begin and end on \emph{do}\\
\item
  approach final tonic by step (usually \emph{re}--\emph{do}, sometimes
  \emph{ti}--\emph{do})\\
\item
  all note-to-note progressions are \href{intervals.html}{melodic
  consonances}\\
\item
  range (interval between lowest and highest notes) of no more than a tenth,
  usually less than an octave\\
\item
  a single climax (high point) that appears only once in the melody\\
\item
  clear logical connection and smooth shape from beginning to climax to
  ending\\
\item
  mostly stepwise motion, but with some leaps (mostly small leaps)\\
\item
  no repetition of ``motives'' or ``licks''\\
\item
  any large leaps (fourth or larger) are followed by step in opposite
  direction\\
\item
  no more than two leaps in a row; no consecutive leaps in the same direction
  (Fux's F-major \emph{cantus} is an exception, where the back-to-back
  descending leaps outline a consonant triad.)\\
\item
  the leading tone progresses to the tonic\\
\item
  in minor, the leading tone only appears in the penultimate bar; the raised
  submediant is only used when progressing to that leading tone
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{melodic-tendencies}{%
\subsubsection{Melodic tendencies}\label{melodic-tendencies}}

The characteristics listed above are fairly detailed, and some of them are
specific to strict species counterpoint. However, taken together, they express
in detail some general tendencies of melodies in a variety of styles.

\href{https://openlibrary.org/works/OL5851060W/Sweet_Anticipation}{David
Huron} identifies five general properties of melodies in Western music that
connect to the basic principles of perception and cognition listed above, but
play out in slightly different specific ways in musical styles. They are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{pitch proximity} -- the tendency for melodies to progress by steps
  more than leaps and by small leaps more than large leaps. An expression of
  smoothness and melodic integrity.\\
\item
  \textbf{step declination} -- the tendency for melodies to move by
  \emph{descending} step more than ascending. Possibly an expression of
  goal-oriented motion, as we tend to perceive a move down as a decrease in
  energy (movement towards a state of rest).\\
\item
  \textbf{step inertia} -- the tendency for melodies to change direction less
  frequently than they continue in the same direction. (I.e., the majority of
  melodic progressions are in the same direction as the previous one.) An
  expression of smoothness and, at times, goal-oriented motion.\\
\item
  \textbf{melodic regression} -- the tendency for melodic notes in extreme
  registers to progress back towards the middle. An expression of motion
  towards a position of rest (with non-extreme notes representing ``rest'').
  Also an expression simply of the statistical distribution of notes in a
  melody: the higher a note is, the more notes there are below it for a
  composer to choose from, and the less notes there are above it.\\
\item
  \textbf{melodic arch} -- the tendency for melodies to ascend in the first
  half of a phrase, reach a climax, and descend in the second half. An
  expression of goal-orientation and the rest--motion--rest pattern. Also, a
  combination of the above rules in the context of a musical phrase.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{first-species-counterpoint}{%
\subsection{First species counterpoint}\label{first-species-counterpoint}}

Counterpoint is the mediation of two or more musical \emph{lines} into a
meaningful and pleasing \emph{whole}. In first-species counterpoint, we not
only write a smooth melody that has its own integrity of shape, variety, and
goal-directed motion, but we also write a second melody that contains these
traits. Further, and most importantly, we combine these melodies to create a
whole texture that is smooth, exhibits variety and goal-oriented motion, and
in which these melodies both maintain their independence and fuse together
into consonant \emph{simultaneities} (the general term for two or more notes
sounding at the same time).

\hypertarget{the-counterpoint-line}{%
\subsubsection{The counterpoint line}\label{the-counterpoint-line}}

In general, the counterpoint should follow the principles of
\href{cantusFirmus.html}{writing a good cantus firmus}. There are some minor
differences, to be discussed below, but generally a first-species counterpoint
should consist of two cantus-firmus-quality lines.

\hypertarget{beginning-a-first-species-counterpoint}{%
\subsubsection{Beginning a first-species
counterpoint}\label{beginning-a-first-species-counterpoint}}

To exemplify goal-oriented motion, the first-species exercise should begin and
end with the most stable of sonorities: perfect consonances. Thus, when
writing a counterpoint \emph{above} a cantus firmus, the first note of the
counterpoint should be \emph{do} or \emph{sol} (a P1, P5, or P8 above the
cantus).

When writing a counterpoint \emph{below} a cantus firmus, the first note of
the counterpoint must always be \emph{do} (P1 or P8 below the cantus).
(Beginning on \emph{sol} would create a dissonant fourth; beginning on
\emph{fa} would create a P5 but confuse listeners about the tonal context,
since \emph{fa--do} at the beginning of a piece is easily misheard as
\emph{do--sol}.)

\hypertarget{ending-a-first-species-counterpoint}{%
\subsubsection{Ending a first-species
counterpoint}\label{ending-a-first-species-counterpoint}}

The final note of the counterpoint must always be \emph{do} (P1 or P8
above/below the cantus).

To approach this ending smoothly, with variety, and with strong goal
orientation, always approach the final interval by contrary stepwise motion.
If the cantus ends \emph{re}--\emph{do}, the counterpoint's final two pitches
should be \emph{ti}--\emph{do}. If the cantus ends \emph{ti}--\emph{do}, the
counterpoint's final two pitches should be \emph{re}--\emph{do}. Thus the
penultimate bar will either be a minor third or a major sixth between the two
lines. This is the case for both major and minor keys.

\hypertarget{independence-of-the-lines}{%
\subsubsection{Independence of the lines}\label{independence-of-the-lines}}

Like the cantus firmus, the counterpoint should have a single climax. To
maintain the independence of the lines and the smoothness of the entire
passage (so no one moment is hyper-emphasized by a double climax), these
climaxes should not coincide.

A single repeat/tie in the counterpoint is allowed, but try to avoid repeating
at all. This promotes variety in the exercise, since there are so few notes to
begin with.

Avoid \emph{voice crossing}, where the upper voice is temporarily lower than
the lower voice, and \emph{vice versa}. Voice crossings diminish the
independence of the lines and make them more difficult to distinguish by ear.

Avoid \emph{voice overlap}, where one voice leaps past the previous note of
the other voice. For example, if the upper part sings an E4, the lower part
cannot sing an F4 in the following bar. This also helps maintain the
independence of the lines.

\hypertarget{intervals-and-motion}{%
\subsubsection{Intervals and motion}\label{intervals-and-motion}}

The interval between the cantus and counterpoint at any moment should not
exceed a perfect twelfth (octave plus fifth). In general, try to keep the two
lines within an octave where possible, and only exceed a tenth in
``emergencies,'' and only briefly (one or two notes). When the voices are too
far apart, tonal fusion is diminished. Further, it can diminish
\emph{performability}, which though not an essential principle of human
cognition is an important consideration for composers, and it has a direct
effect on the smoothness, melodic integrity, and tonal fusion of what
listeners hear during a performance.

In general, all harmonic \emph{consonances} are allowed. However, unisons
should only be used for first and last intervals. Unisons are very stable, and
serve best as goals rather than mid points. They also diminish the
independence of the lines.

\emph{Imperfect consonances} are preferable to \emph{perfect consonances} for
all intervals other than the first and last dyads, in order to heighten the
sense of arrival at the end, and to promote a sense of motion towards that
arrival. In all cases, aim for a variety of harmonic intervals over the course
of the exercise.

\emph{Never, ever, ever} use two perfect consonances of the same size in a
row: \textbf{P5--P5} or \textbf{P8--P8}. This includes both simple and
compound intervals. For example, \textbf{P5--P12} is considered the same as
\textbf{P5--P5}. (Two different perfect consonances in a row, such as
\textbf{P8--P5}, is allowed, however, but try to follow every perfect
consonance with an imperfect consonance if possible.) These ``parallel fifths
and octaves'' significantly promote tonal fusion over melodic independence at
the same time that the consecutive stable sonorities arrest both the variety
and the motion of the exercise. Thus, they are far from ideal, and to be
avoided in species counterpoint.

Vary the types of motion between successive intervals (parallel, similar,
contrary, oblique). Try to use all types of motion (except, perhaps, oblique
motion), but prefer contrary motion where possible. It is best for preserving
the independence of the lines, in addition to variety.

Because similar and parallel motion diminish variety and melodic independence,
their use should be mediated by other factors:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Do not use more than three of the same imperfect consonance type in a row
  (e.g., three thirds in a row).\\
\item
  \emph{Never} move into a perfect consonance by similar motion (this is
  called \emph{direct} or \emph{hidden octaves}). This draws too much
  attention to an interval which already stands out of the texture.\\
\item
  Avoid combining similar motion with leaps, especially large ones.
\end{itemize}

divisible by 3.

\textbf{Duple triple, and quadruple all mean the same thing they do in simple

- Top = if you divide by 3, that's how many beats there are? (Yes, but this
doesn't tell us what the numbers mean) - \emph{Top = how many of the note in

\hypertarget{compound-meters}{%
\subsection{Compound meters}\label{compound-meters}}

Meters that divide the beat into three equal parts are \emph{compound meters}.

When combined with simple meters, there are six types of standard meter in
Western music:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  simple duple (beats group into two, divide into two)
\item
  simple triple (beats group into three, divide into two)
\item
  simple quadruple (beats group into four, divide into two)
\item
  compound duple (beats group into two, divide into three)
\item
  compound triple (beats group into three, divide into three)
\item
  compound quadruple (beats group into four, divide into three)
\end{itemize}

In a time signature, the \emph{top number} (and the top number only!)
describes the type of meter. Following are the top numbers that always
correspond to each type of meter:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  simple duple: 2
\item
  simple triple: 3
\item
  simple quadruple: 4
\item
  compound duple: 6
\item
  compound triple: 9
\item
  compound quadruple: 12
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{notating-meter-1}{%
\subsection{Notating meter}\label{notating-meter-1}}

In \emph{compound meters}, the bottom number of the time signature corresponds
to the type of note corresponding to \emph{a single division of the beat}. If
a compound meter is notated such that each dotted-quarter note corresponds to
a beat, the eighth note is the division of the beat, and thus the bottom
number of the time signature is 8. If a compound meter is notated such that
each dotted-half note corresponds to a beat, the quarter note is the division
of the beat, and thus the bottom number of the time signature is 4. Note that
because the beat is divided into three in a compound meter, the beat is always
three times as long as the division note, and \emph{the beat is always
dotted}.

\hypertarget{chord-voicing-1}{%
\subsection{Chord voicing}\label{chord-voicing-1}}

In strict keyboard-style writing, there are four voices: the bass line (which
is usually a given in \emph{basso continuo} style), and three \emph{upper
voices}: the \emph{melody} or \emph{soprano}, the \emph{alto}, and the
\emph{tenor} (from highest to lowest). Since all three upper voices must be
played by a single hand, they should never span more than an octave.

The melody always has an upward-pointing stem. Alto and tenor share a
downward-pointing stem. If the alto and tenor share a note, that note receives
a single downward-pointing stem. (See m. 1 of the example below.) If melody
and alto share a note, that notehead is double-stemmed. (See m. 4 of the
example below.)

\href{images/BCModel.png}{\includegraphics{images/BCModel.png}}

When choosing the notes to place in the upper voices above a figured bass, use
the bass and figures to determine the pitch classes present in the chord.
(When realizing an \emph{unfigured bass}, you must determine appropriate
figures before realizing.) If the chord is a four-note chord, use each chord
member once, including the bass (exceptions will be noted later). If a chord
has three pitch-classes (a triad, for instance), use each pitch-class once,
and ``double'' one of them according to the following principles:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the figure is 6/4, 5/3, or other chord of the fifth, double the bass
  pitch class.\\
\item
  If the figure is 6/3 and the bass is a \emph{fixed scale degree} (\emph{do},
  \emph{re}, \emph{fa}, or \emph{sol}), double the bass pitch class.\\
\item
  If the figure is 6/3 and the bass is a \emph{variable scale degree}
  (\emph{mi}/\emph{me}, \emph{la}/\emph{le}, or \emph{ti}/\emph{te}) or a
  chromatically altered pitch, double one of the upper voices at the octave or
  unison.\\
\item
  Generally, do not double a variable scale degree or a chromatically altered
  pitch.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{tendency-tones-1}{%
\subsection{Tendency tones}\label{tendency-tones-1}}

A \emph{tendency tone} is a pitch (class)---usually represented as a scale
degree---that tends to progress to some pitch classes more than others.
Sometimes this tendency is absolute within a style, but more often it is
context-dependent.

The most prominent tendency tones in Western tonal styles are \emph{ti} (not
\emph{te}) and \emph{le} (not \emph{la}).

Generally speaking, when \emph{ti} appears it tends to be followed by
\emph{do} in the same voice. In a harmonic context, this tendency is strongest
when \emph{ti} occurs in a dominant-functioning chord, and the ``resolution''
of that tendency comes upon change of function (to tonic or predominant).

Likewise, when \emph{le} appears, it tends to be followed by \emph{sol} in the
same voice. This tendency is less dependent on function.

Exceptions to these tendencies include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When \emph{ti} is in the middle of a stepwise descent
  (\emph{re}--\emph{do}--\emph{ti}--\emph{la}--\emph{sol}, for example), it
  can progress down by step. (Note that \emph{step inertia} here diminishes
  the effect of an ``unresolved'' tendency tone. Because there are two
  conflicting tendencies in play, in this case, either can be ``resolved''
  unproblematically.)\\
\item
  When \emph{ti} is in an inner voice, it can progress down to \emph{sol} if
  necessary to accomplish good voice-leading in the other voices and ensure
  complete chords. This is called a \emph{frustrated leading-tone}.\\
\item
  When \emph{ti} is a functional dissonance of a tonic-functioning chord (see
  below) it should progress down by step.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{functional-dissonances-1}{%
\subsection{Functional dissonances}\label{functional-dissonances-1}}

Some tendencies, such as the tendency for \emph{le} to progress down, are
relatively context-independent. Others are heavily contextualized. The primary
contextual tendency for how melodic notes progress is the concept of
\emph{functional dissonance}.

Keep in mind from the \href{harmonicFunctions.html}{Harmonic functions
resource} that chords tend to cluster in one of three functional groups
(\textbf{T}, \textbf{P}, or \textbf{D}) When pitches fuse into a chord
expressing one of these three functions, the pitches that comprise that have
certain tendencies of progression that they may or may not have in other
contexts.

Following are the scale degrees which act as dissonances for their respective
functions:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}rc@{}}
\toprule
function & dissonances \\
\midrule
\endhead
T or Tx & 7, 5 when 6 is also present \\
P & 3, 1 when 2 is also present \\
D & 4, 6 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

In purely diatonic music (triads and seventh chords, no chromatics), these
will include \emph{the seventh of every seventh chord}, \emph{the fifth of
viiº or VII} (\emph{fa}), and \emph{the fifth of III or iii} (\emph{ti/te}).

Keep in mind that only sometimes do these functional dissonances express
themselves in chords or intervals that are acoustically dissonant. However,
they do introduce a degree of tension that, like an acoustically dissonant
interval in species counterpoint, requires a smooth introduction and a
specific resolution.

When one of these scale degrees is present in a chord with the corresponding
function, the dissonant scale degree has a strong tendency to \emph{resolve
down by step over the next change in function}. In strict composition, we will
\emph{always} follow these tendencies.

In strict keyboard style, these functional dissonances should be ``prepared''
(approached) by common tone or by step. Thus, though they are proper members
of the chord, melodically they will look like one of the three dissonance
types of species counterpoint: a \emph{passing tone} or \emph{neighbor tone}
dissonance that is approached by step, or a \emph{suspension} dissonance that
is approached by a common tone. The suspension type is preferred.

Once a functional dissonance is introduced, it must be resolved down by step
in the same voice when the function changes. The dissonance can also be
\emph{transferred} to another voice before resolution---for instance, if there
are multiple chords in a row exhibiting the same function, a dissonance that
appears in the alto can be transferred to the tenor in the following chord,
and then resolve in the tenor when the function changes. (It is more typical,
and smoother sounding, to transfer dissonances between inner voices or from an
inner voice to an outer voice than from an outer voice to an inner voice. Once
a dissonance appears in the melody or bass, where it is more noticeable, it
tends to resolve in that voice.)

Functional dissonance resolutions often cause conflicts with other principles
of voice leading. Except in special cases such as \emph{schemata} (standard
patterns that are common enough to sound appropriate, even if they follow
different rules), the functional dissonance resolution takes precedence over
other principles such as the \emph{law of the shortest way}, contrary motion
with the bass, and preferring common tones and steps to melodic leaps. A
dissonance resolution is never an excuse for illegal parallels, and only
rarely will lead to non-standard doublings.

Process of harmonic analysis - What you should try and do as early as possible
is determine the \emph{harmonic rhythm}, or how often the chord changes. This
can happen every beat, every measure, or many other ways. The chorale we
looked at in class is an example where the harmonic rhythm is every beat. -
Key: try not to rely as much on the key signature to figure out what key
you're in. Think of it as just one of many tools. There are other indicators
of key--what chord does the section start on? What accidentals are repeatedly
occurring in the section? Do these fit in with a major key or a minor one? -
Leadsheet: doing this first will save time in writing out your Roman numerals,
especially if you are still unsure of what key you're in. - \emph{You do not
need to repeat the Roman numerals for multiples of the same chord in a row.}

\hypertarget{the-three-common-practice-harmonic-functions}{%
\section{The three common-practice harmonic
functions}\label{the-three-common-practice-harmonic-functions}}

In common-practice music, harmonies tend to cluster around three high-level
categories of harmonic function. These categories are traditionally called
\emph{tonic} (\textbf{T}), \emph{pre-dominant} (\textbf{P} --- sometimes
referred to as \emph{subdominant}, \textbf{S}), and \emph{dominant}
(\textbf{D}). Each of these functions has their own characteristic scale
degrees, with their own characteristic tendencies. And each of these functions
tend to participate in certain kinds of chord progressions more than others.

If you are already comfortable with Roman numerals, you can generally think of
\textbf{I}, \textbf{III}, and \textbf{VI} as \emph{tonic}, \textbf{II} and
\textbf{IV} as \emph{pre-dominant}, and \textbf{V} and \textbf{VII} as
\emph{dominant}. (Though, as you will see below, there is more to it than
that.)

To visualize these functional categories, think of the usual triads in C major
arranged on a circle of thirds. Note that each chord sits between the two
triads that share the most tones in common --- C major (C, E, G) sits between
E minor (E, G, B) and A minor (A, C, E), both of which share two tones in
common with C.

Convert these chords to Roman numerals (in C major), and we can see the
functions. Since the function is determined by the tendencies of the tones
that they share, and since on this graph chords are grouped together by notes
they have in common, they are also grouped together by function.

\emph{Triads arranged on the circle of thirds, labeled by harmonic functions.}

Interestingly, in common-practice music, a chord's function can be determined
solely by its internal characteristics (the notes that make up the chord).
This is not true of all styles. For example, in pop/rock music a \textbf{IV}
chord can exhibit very different functional tendencies depending on its
context. But in classical music, simply knowing the notes in a chord is enough
to determine its general harmonic function and the general tendencies of that
chord and its individual notes.

The syntactic properties of these functions will be covered elsewhere. What
follows simply explains how to determine the function of a chord in
common-practice music with greater specificity.

\hypertarget{finding-the-function-of-a-chord}{%
\section{Finding the function of a
chord}\label{finding-the-function-of-a-chord}}

Each of the three harmonic functions --- \emph{tonic} (T), \emph{pre-dominant}
(P), and \emph{dominant} (D) --- have characteristic scale degrees. Tonic's
characteristic scale degrees are 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7. Pre-dominant's
characteristic scale degrees are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Dominant's characteristic
scale degrees are 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

Ian Quinn (a music theorist at Yale University) further distinguishes these
scale degrees, using the categories of functional \emph{triggers}, functional
\emph{associates}, and functional \emph{dissonances}. These categories help us
understand the functional properties of chords whose scale degrees belong to
more than one function, as well as how certain notes behave within a chord.
They also help us understand which scale degrees are more or less
characteristic of a function ― something that will help determine function
when a complete chord is not present.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}clll@{}}
\toprule
function & triggers & associates & dissonances \\
\midrule
\endhead
\textbf{T} & 1 and 3 & 5 and 6 & 5 (if 6 is also present) and 7 \\
\textbf{P} & 4 and 6 & 1 and 2 & 1 (if 2 is also present) and 3 \\
\textbf{D} & 5 and 7 & 2 & 4 and 6 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

In terms of moveable-\emph{do} solfège:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}clll@{}}
\toprule
function & triggers & associates & dissonances \\
\midrule
\endhead
\textbf{T} & \emph{do} and \emph{mi}/\emph{me} & \emph{sol} and
\emph{la}/\emph{le} & \emph{sol} (if \emph{la}/\emph{le} is also present) and
\emph{ti}/\emph{te} \\
\textbf{P} & \emph{fa} and \emph{la}/\emph{le} & \emph{do} and \emph{re} &
\emph{do} (if \emph{re} is also present) and \emph{mi}/\emph{me} \\
\textbf{D} & \emph{sol} and \emph{ti}/\emph{te} & \emph{re} & \emph{fa} and
\emph{la}/\emph{le} \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

To determine the function of a chord, find the function that includes all the
scale degrees of a chord (regardless of chromatic alterations ― that is, treat
♯4 the same as regular scale-degree 4). If more than one function contains all
the scale degrees, take the function with the most triggers in the chord.

There is one exception to this (for now): a chord with scale degrees 6, 1, and
3 is a special kind of tonic chord, called a \emph{destabilized tonic}. Quinn
uses the special functional label is \textbf{Tx}, rather than simply
\textbf{T}, for this chord.

Also note that because the III7 chord's scale-degrees do not wholly belong to
any of the three functions, it can behave similar to \textbf{T} and \textbf{D}
chords, depending on context. It is a rare chord in its diatonic form.

\href{/images/Handouts/HarmoniesByBassScaleDegree.pdf}{This handout} will help
you determine the function of a chord from the bass scale degree and/or the
Roman numeral.

\hypertarget{the-keyboard}{%
\subsection{The Keyboard}\label{the-keyboard}}

The keyboard is great for helping you develop a visual, aural, and tactile
understanding of music theory. On the illustration below, the
\emph{pitch-class} letter names are written on the keyboard.

\includegraphics{images/keyboardlayout-small.png}

\hypertarget{enharmonic-equivalence}{%
\subsection{Enharmonic equivalence}\label{enharmonic-equivalence}}

Notice that some of the keys have two names. When two pitch classes share a
key on the keyboard, they are said to have \emph{enharmonic equivalence}.
Theoretically, each key could have several names (the note C could also be
considered D♭♭, for instance), but it's usually not necessary to know more
than two enharmonic spellings.

\hypertarget{octave-designation}{%
\subsection{Octave Designation}\label{octave-designation}}

When specifying a particular pitch precisely, we also need to know the
\emph{register}. In fact, if all you have is C-sharp or B-flat, you do not
have a \emph{pitch}, you have a \emph{pitch-class}. A pitch-class plus a
register together designate a specific pitch.

We will follow the International Standards Organization (ISO) system for
register designations. In that system, middle C (the first ledger line above
the bass staff or the first ledger line below the treble staff) is C4. An
octave higher than middle C is C5, and an octave lower than middle C is C3.

Here is the pitch C4 placed on the treble, bass, alto, and tenor clefs.

The tricky bit about this system is that the octave starts on C and ends on B.
So an ascending scale from middle C contains the following pitch designations:

\includegraphics{images/C4toC5.png}

And a descending scale from middle C contains the following pitch
designations:

\includegraphics{images/C4toC3.png}

Pitches on the alto staff are as follows:

\includegraphics{images/F3toG4-alto.png}

Pitches on the tenor staff are as follows:

Any accidentals follow the octave designation of the natural pitch with the
same generic name. Thus a half step below C4 is C-flat4 (even though it sounds
the same as B3), and a half step above C4 is C-sharp4.

Note that a complete designation contains both the pitch-class name (a letter
name plus an optional sharp or flat) and the register (the ISO number
indicating the octave in which the pitch is found). Unless both are present,
you do not have the full designation of a specific pitch.

\textbf{Double Neighbor Tones} Decorates a single pitch, has to come back to
the original pitch. - Enclosure! It doesnt matter if you to up or down first,

together.

\textbf{Appoggiatura (APP)} Approached by leap and left by step in the
opposite direction.

\textbf{Escape Tone (ET)} Approached by step and left by leap in the opposite
direction.

\emph{appoggiaturas and escape tones are the most common NCT's}

\textbf{Anticipations (ANT)} A reverse suspension, although not upsidedown
like retardations. Putting your car in reverse doesn't put it on its roof. - A
chord tone that shows up too early. - Its going to be a chord tone soon, but
not yet because the chord hasn't changed yet. - Static motion!

\textbf{Pedals (PED)} Any non chord tone approached by static motion and left
by static motion across at least three chords. When labeling with a pedal, use
the next voice up to determine inversion.

\textbf{``Figure''} It has the right shape, but aren't non-chord tones. This

\textbf{Common tone diminished chords} - These are similar to +6 chords in
that they don't quite work right. These also exist just as decoration/voice
leading into the next chord. It's made up entirely of tendency tones to make
the resolution really strong - Confusing to ID because they look like another
chord - Whether a chord is a ct07 depends on what comes \emph{after} it. If
we're in C and we have a D\#07/C, it can be either a ct07 or a vii07/iii. If
the next chord is iii, it's the latter. If it's I, the chord is a ct07. - The
other common Roman numeral that comes after a ct07 is V - Do not label
inversions of ct07s. Like +6 chords their function doesn't work with our
system of inversion labeling

\textbf{Constructing a ct07} - A ct07 going to I will look like a \#ii07,
while a ct07 going to V will look like a \#vi07. These two points of reference
are helpful for knowing what notes you need, but be aware that writing these
in ``root position'' will be incorrect - Again: these chords exist for cool
voice leading! If you just write it in root position, all of that cool voice
leading goes away. One way to ensure the voice leading is correct is to write
the following chord next to it in root position, then construct your ct07 from
there by determining what all the notes should resolve to

These are also used in enharmonic modulations and you just label them as ct07
like usual

Intervals}\label{mediant-harmony-and-idealized-voice-leading-intervals}}

How do we judge good voice leading?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Stepwise and static motion
\item
  The chordal thirds resolve how you expect
\end{itemize}

If you put chords in closed position voicing without the bass line there's not
much movement.

If you count the half steps it takes to move between two chords and take the
total you have IVI, or Idealized Voice-Leading Intervals.

Which chords have the lowest IVI?

The ones that share two common tones.

Anytime we have harmonies whose roots relate by a 3rd those chords have smooth
voice leading because they share two tones.

Mediant Harmony allows composers to have smooth voice leading while using
interesting harmony.

Ex: G7 - D

\begin{itemize}
\item
  GBDF to DF\#A
\item
  G moves to F\#, B moves to A, D stays the same, F moves to F\#.
\item
  IVI:5
\end{itemize}

Voice-leading for IVI is not the same as writing for a chorale.

Bass lines don't follow the rules of IVI for smooth voice-leading.

Ex: Bbm - Co7

\begin{itemize}
\item
  BbDbF to CEbGbBbb
\item
  Bb moves to Bbb, Db moves to Eb and C, F moves to Gb.
\item
  IVI:5
\end{itemize}

Ex: G - Fmaj7

\item
  GBD to FACE

  G moves to F and A, B moves to C, D moves to E.

\section{Mediant Harmony}\label{mediant-harmony-1}}

The mediant harmony: or any harmony whose root starts a 3rd away.

These chords are the mediant and borrowed mediant, and the submediant and
borrowed submediant.

We are left with (in C) Eb, Em, Ab, Am.

We have 4 more mediant harmony chords, and they come from changing the quality
of the previous chords.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Ebm, E, Abm, A.
\end{itemize}

In total we have 4 chromatic mediant chords (Ebm, Eb, Em, E) and 4 chromatic
submediant chords (Abm, Ab, Am, A).

Diatonic mediants: the two mediants that are in the key.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In C major, Em and Am.
\item
  your diatonic mediants always have 2 common tones and opposite chord
  qualities.
\end{itemize}

Chromatic mediants: the 4 mediants that are borrowed from the parallel minor
and the opposite chord quality of the diatonic mediants.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In C major, Eb, Ab, E, and A.
\item
  Eb and Ab are from the parallel minor while the E and A are opposite chord
  qualities of diatonic mediants.
\end{itemize}

Doubly chromatic mediants: the 2 mediants that are not in the key, but are the
opposite chord qualities of the parallel minor mediants.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In C major, Ebm and Abm.
\end{itemize}

You find the first 4 mediants by using the diatonic and chromatic mediants
(the 2 from major and 2 from the parallel minor).

How do you find the inversion of the number? - you take the number and go that
many around the given pitch. - if we are inverting over 0, the inversion of 3
is -3. - -14 -13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14

What if we apply Mod 12 to this idea? - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 t e 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
t e - we get the same idea by mirroring numbers over the clock, putting the
mirror down the line between 0 and 6. - the inversions of each number are: - 1
e, 2 t, 3 9, 4 8, 5 7, 6 6. - if you're using the clock for inversion, you can
move the mirror axis to any number and treat it the same.

\hypertarget{ex-c-major-triad}{%
\subsubsection{Ex: C major triad}\label{ex-c-major-triad}}

What is the pitch class set for a C major triad? (0,4,7). What is the
inversion? (0,8,5). - the normal form of the inversion is {[}5,8,0{]}.

The chord made is a F minor triad, because we directly flipped the intervals
around C. \#\#\# Transposition and Inversion When you have to transpose and
invert a PC set, the formula is TnI(). \#\#\#\# Which is correct? 1. Transpose
- ex: T4I(1,5,6) - (5,9,t) 2. Invert - (7,3,2) 3. Find normal form -
{[}2,3,7{]}

\textbf{OR} 1. Invert - ex: T4I(1,5,6) - (e,7,6) 2. Find normal form -
{[}6,7,e{]} 3. Transpose - next we transpose by adding n (4) to each interger.
- {[}t,e,3{]}

The SECOND OPTION is correct. By transposing first, it changes the axis you
invert over. You have to invert first, THEN transpose. You have to wait to
find normal form until AFTER you invert the PC set.

Shortcut: - subtract n by each interger, then set it in normal form. - ex:
T9I(4,3,1) - 9-4=5 - 9-3=6 - 9-1=8 - so our PC set is (5,6,8), and normal form
is {[}5,6,8{]}

\#\#\# Set Class Think of pitch class, it is a combination of pitches, thus a
PC set. So set class, is a collection of pitch class sets.

Heirarchy: - pitch class (1) - pitch class set (1,4,7) - set class
(1,4,7);(2,5,8);(3,6,9);(4,7,t);(5,8,e);(6,9,0); etc\ldots{}

A set class for (0,4,7), a major triad, all of its transpositions and
inversions create 24 PC sets, making one large set class. This includes all
major and minor triads in interger notation. - a way to decrease a set class
is using a symmetrical chord

\hypertarget{inversion-1}{%
\subsection{Inversion}\label{inversion-1}}

Inversion, like transposition, is often associated with motion that connects
similar objects. You need to be able to (1) invert a collection of pitches and
(2) determine the inversional relationship between two collections of pitches.

\href{/images/postTonal/inversion.png}{\includegraphics{/images/postTonal/inversion.png}}

This passage above from Debussy's ``Sunken Cathedral'' is an example. Just as
was the case in the
\protect\hyperlink{transposition-1}{transpositionally-related passages}, these
two gestures have the same intervallic content---and so, our ears recognize
them as very similar. (Debussy underscores that similarity by giving both of
the gestures the same rhythmic setting.) Unlike transposition, however, the
interval content of these two gestures is not \emph{arranged} in the same way.

\href{/images/postTonal/inversionallyRelated.png}{\includegraphics{/images/postTonal/inversionallyRelated.png}}

Both have the same intervals, but the \{A,D,E\} collection has the +5 on the
bottom instead of on the top.

Inverting something is a two-step process, performed \emph{in this order}: (1)
Reflect the pitch classes in an object around the 0-6 axis of symmetry, and
then (2) transpose it. I'll illustrate first on a clock, and then show you an
easier way:

\href{/images/postTonal/invertingWithAClock.png}{\includegraphics{/images/postTonal/invertingWithAClock.png}}

Fortunately, there is a much quicker way to invert a pitch or collection of
pitches! Given any collection of pitch classes and a \emph{TnI}, simply
subtract the the pitch classes from \emph{n:}

\href{/images/postTonal/differences.png}{\includegraphics{/images/postTonal/differences.png}}

Conversely, to determine the \emph{TnI} that relates two collections of pitch
classes, find a common value to which they all sum. That is the \emph{n} in
\emph{TnI:}

\textbf{Other secondary functions} - What is up with this weird mystery
chord??? (Gmin in C major) - Is it a iv/ii? It's followed by a V/ii, so is it
just an extended progression?: Yep! It looks kind of weird, but that's exactly
what it is. - \emph{Contextual analysis tips:} always be thinking about what
you're analyzing actually \emph{sounds.} All Roman numerals do is label
function. They're like a legend indicating what we hear - Think of chords in a
secondary progression as being tied together by a string. In our progression
iv/ii - V42/ii - ii6 - V7 - I, the first three chords are basically a bundle
setting up our V7.

\textbf{Ambiguous secondary functions} - You can also label the Am chord as
ii/V. You shouldn't do that, because it's overthinking, but you could.
Remember: \emph{always be thinking about what you're analyzing actually sounds
like.} How does the Am chord function? Label it properly in order to reflect
what you hear.

\hypertarget{class-discussion-41}{%
\chapter{Class discussion}\label{class-discussion-41}}

Welcome to post-tonal analysis!

\textbf{The importance of pitch notation in tonal harmony} - In this example,
we talked about determining implied key and progression just from looking at
the accidentals, harmonic intervals, and resolution. - Both measure contain a
a tritone, and they each resolve in a different way: one outward, one inward.
This results in resolutions to different keys from enharmonically equivalent
chords.

\textbf{Happy Birthday in G Major (a la R. Strauss)} - Welcome to pitch class
integer notation!! - Remember we only use 0-e in this form of notation. 0 is
also 12 (and 1 is also 13, 2 is also 14, etc\ldots) - In this system, there is
no difference between C\# and Db. Both are written as 1. While it's important
to distinguish these notes in tonality, we're post-tonal! The notes don't
matter. - All enharmonic equivalents are called a pitch class. This also
includes double sharps and double flats. For example, C\#, Db\#, and Bx are
all in the same pitch, class, represented as 1. - What reasons are there to
use this system? - Quickly identifying pitches (or pitch classes) -
Identifying non-diatonic scales? - Is C always 0? - In fixed zero notation,
yes! There is also movable zero notation. Much like fixed and movable do, both
of these notations have their uses.

\textbf{Scales labeled using multiple zeros in pc integer notation} - Notice
each scale is made up of a repeating 4-number pattern. In this example we can
see a major scale is based around 0245, Dorian mode is based around 0235, and
HW octatonic is based around 0134. - Movable zero is helpful for this kind of
thing because we can quickly identify patterns in smaller things, like the
scales here. It identifies the specific intervallic framework of a section,
based around one note.

A \emph{pitch-class set} (pcs) is a collection of pitch classes.
\emph{Cardinality} is the number of pitch classes within a pcs. 0245 is a pcs,
and since it has 4 pitch classes in it we call it a tetrachord. We run into
problems with some of these cardinality terms because some of the words are
the same as ones we associate with tonality.

\textbf{What is the application of an empty set?} - We need it for when we
start inverting things later. An empty set is the inverse of an aggregate,
containing all twelve pitch classes.

Our ``normal'' scales and modes would be called septachords, because they
contain seven pitch classes.

\textbf{Can you apply this system of notation to tonal music?} - You
\emph{can}! The example Dr.~Butterfield pulled up in class was Hindemith's
Trumpet Sonata, which he called ``a mess to play'' but went through using pc
integer notation to look at the piece intervallically and not have to
transpose as much

Tonality is highly charged system where \emph{scale degrees} are endowed with
a magnetic or gravitational pull towards other tones. Within the key of C
major, B-natural is attracted to the tonic C, other members of the dominant
triad are attracted to the tonic triad, and other scale degrees have functions
as well. \emph{Spelling} is extremely important within common-practice
tonality. A-flat --- as lowered scale degree 6 --- leads to G, but G-sharp ---
as raised scale degree 5 --- leads to A. Underlying ``scale degree'' and
``spelling'' are two important concepts that will influence our study of
post-tonal music.

\hypertarget{octave-equivalence}{%
\subsection{Octave Equivalence}\label{octave-equivalence}}

''Scale degree'' implies an \emph{equivalence} between
\href{pitches.html}{pitches} that are spelled the same but any number of
octaves apart. C4 is the same as C3 is the same as C9, and so on. The concept
of scale degree, then, has the idea of \emph{octave equivalence} embedded
within it.

\hypertarget{enharmonic-equivalence-1}{%
\subsection{Enharmonic Equivalence}\label{enharmonic-equivalence-1}}

Though \emph{octave equivalence} is central to our understanding of tonal
music, enharmonic equivalence often is not. In the key of C major, A-flat and
G-sharp are \emph{not} equivalent, though in isolation they sound the same.
Spelling often indicates tendency: A-flat \emph{falls} to G and G-sharp
\emph{rises} to A.

In post-tonal music, enharmonic equivalence is often assumed --- with
exceptions of course. Because many composers no longer felt constrained by a
tonal center, the same gravitational relationships amongst tones that we find
in tonal music aren't important. A-flat and G-sharp, therefore, can be treated
as representations of the same thing.

\hypertarget{pitch}{%
\subsection{Pitch}\label{pitch}}

\emph{Pitches} are discrete tones with individual frequencies. The concept of
pitch, then, does not imply octave equivalence. C4 is a pitch, and it is not
the same pitch as C3.

\hypertarget{pitch-class}{%
\subsection{Pitch class}\label{pitch-class}}

Pitch classes are \emph{pitches} under octave equivalence that are also
spelled the same. A4, A3, A2, etc. are all members of the pitch class A.

\textbf{Pitch Space}

\href{/images/postTonal/Pitch-Space.jpg}{\includegraphics{/images/postTonal/Pitch-Space.jpg}}

\hypertarget{integer-notation}{%
\subsection{Integer notation}\label{integer-notation}}

When analyzing post-tonal music where assuming octave equivalence and
enharmonic equivalence is appropriate, we can use integers to represent pitch
class. All C's and any notes that are enharmonically-equivalent to C (B-sharp,
for example) are pitch class 0. All C-sharps's and any notes that are
enharmonically-equivalent to C-sharp (D-flat, for example) are pitch class 1.
And so on: C = 0, C-sharp = 1, D = 2, D-sharp = 3, E = 4, F = 5, F-sharp = 6,
G = 7, G-sharp = 8, A = 9, B-flat = 10 (T), and B = 1 1 (E).

This type of pitch-class, which assumes octave and enharmonic equivalence is
easily visualized on a clock-face diagram, like the one below.

\hypertarget{disclaimer}{%
\subsection{Disclaimer!}\label{disclaimer}}

Post-tonal music is extremely various. Composers have individual compositional
styles, aesthetic goals, and unique conceptions of pitch. All this is to say
that you must approach a composition with flexibility. For example: because it
is quasi-tonal, Debussy's music often benefits from a view that does
\emph{not} assume enharmonic equivalence. But sometimes it does. You must rely
on your musical intuitions when analyzing this music, and you should also be
willing to approach pitch in these compositions from multiple perspectives
until you find one that seems most appropriate.

\hypertarget{atonal-glossary}{%
\section{Atonal glossary}\label{atonal-glossary}}

\emph{this glossary is far from complete, in the very early stages of being
built}

\textbf{collection} -- The general term for treating multiple pitch classes as
a single entity. Sets, set classes, scales, simultaneities, chords, and
intervals are all specific kinds of collections.

\textbf{interval class} -- The number of semitones between two \emph{pitch
classes}, counted as the shortest distance between them on a clock face. For
instance, C and E make an interval class of 4. This is always the case, no
matter which \emph{pitch} is higher or lower, because interval class is
concerned only with \emph{pitch classes}. Interval classes are labeled
\textbf{ic1}, \textbf{ic2}, . . . \textbf{ic6}. (There are none smaller than
\textbf{ic1} or larger than \textbf{ic6}.)

\textbf{interval vector} -- The interval vector of a set class describes all
of the interval classes present in a set class. There are six interval classes
(1--6). The interval vector gives the number of each of those intervals in
order from 1 to 6, within angle brackets. An interval vector of
\textbf{\textless101102\textgreater{}} means that the set has one ic1
(semitone/major seventh), no ic2s, one ic3 (minor third/major sixth), one ic4
(major third/minor sixth), no ic5s (perfect fourths), and two ic6s (tritones).

\textbf{ordered pitch interval} -- The number of semitones from one pitch (not
pitch class) to the next. Ascending intervals are denoted by positive numbers,
descending intervals by negative numbers. Examples: B4--G5 would have an
ordered pitch interval of 8 (eight ascending semitones). B3--G5 would be 20.
B4--G4 would be --4.

\textbf{ordered pitch-class interval} -- The number of \emph{ascending}
semitones from one pitch-class to another. G--B is four semitones, for an
ordered PC interval of \textbf{4}. B--G is eight ascending semitones, for an
ordered PC interval of \textbf{8}.

The ordered pitch-class interval is also the modulo12 version of the ordered
pitch interval. For example, B4--G4 is --4 semitones (4 semitones down).
mod12(--4) = 8. C3--D4 is 14 semitones. mod12(14) = 2.

\textbf{pitch} -- A pitch class in a specific register, such as C4 (middle C).

\textbf{pitch class} -- One of the twelve steps on the chromatic scale,
summarized by a note name (C, D-sharp, B-flat, etc.) or a number 0--11 (C = 0,
C-sharp = 1, . . . B = 11). In atonal music, spelling rarely matters except to
make performance easier, so enharmonically equivalent pitch classes are
considered identical (C = B-sharp = D-double-flat = 0).

\textbf{pitch-class set} -- An \emph{unordered} collection of pitch classes,
usually grouped into curly brackets: \{C, E, G\}, \{D, E-flat, G\}, or \{4, 5,
9\}.

\textbf{pitch-class set class} or simply \textbf{set class} -- A category of
pitch-class sets that are all related by transposition or inversion. For
example, the 12 major triads are all related by transposition. While each
major triad is a different pitch-class set, they all belong to the same set
class (the same category of sets). Note that minor triads are upside-down
major triads (minor third--major third, instead of major third--minor third).
Thus since major and minor triads can be related by inversion, they belong to
the same set class. Set classes are typically named according to their
\emph{prime form} (see \emph{prime form} in this glossary).

\textbf{prime form} -- Since set classes come in as many as 24 different forms
(12 transpositions times 2 inversions), one of those forms is chosen as its
name or referential form, for ease of categorization. That form is the prime
form. The prime form is, in a nutshell, the inversion and rotation of the set
class that keeps the pitch classes most tightly packed on and above C (0).

For help finding the prime form of a set, Jay Tomlin's
\href{http://www.jaytomlin.com/music/settheory/}{set theory calculator} can be
helpful. The following video demonstrates how to use it.

SetTheoryCalculator from Kris Shaffer on Vimeo.

\textbf{simultaneity} -- Any collection of more than one pitch (class) that
sound at the same time. This includes dyads/intervals, chords, clusters, and
``salami slices'' of contrapuntal textures.

\textbf{unordered pitch-class interval} -- A regular \emph{simple} chromatic
interval: the number of half steps between two pitches. Compound intervals
(larger than an octave) are typically reduced to their corresponding simple
interval. They are labeled with a lower-case \textbf{i}: \textbf{i4} is a
major third, for example.

LEAD SHEET
\textgreater\textgreater\textgreater\textgreater\textgreater\textgreater\textgreater\textgreater{}
EVERYTHING

We \emph{highly} recommend that if you weren't doing lead sheet notation first
in your analyses, you start now. It's especially important to do it this way
now because we're getting into modulation, and lead sheet will keep you from
having to go back and re-do a bunch of work, which might happen if you try and
do Roman numerals first. Remember: Roman numerals label function, whereas lead
sheet just labels chords. To figure out what the music is doing, first we have
to know what we have.

\textbf{Pivot modulations (Common chord pivot modulations)} - Three important
questions: - Where do you first hear something changing? - How is the change
prepared? - What harmonies transition in and out of modulation? - With pivot
modulations, you always modulate before you actually hear it. There's always
an overlap with the previous key where the pivot modulation happens--there has
to be a functional progression on both sides of the pivot chord - Ideally,
your pivot chord is the chord \emph{right} before you hear the modulation.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In the Haydn example, we don't hear the modulation until the C\# in the bass
  in the second system. So, the chord in the first half of the same measure (I
  in G, IV in D) is where we would actually put the pivot chord bracket.
\item
  Another ex: in the Tchaikovsky example, we hear the modulation in the second
  to last measure. The chord in the second half of the measure right before it
  is D major, which is I in the original key and Vi in the new key--a perfect
  pivot chord! It fits right into a standard circle-of-fifths progression.
\item
  If you have a lot of V/V - V - V/V - etc. in a row, chances are you have
  modulated and are now in a new key. This is the case for any new key, not
  just V.
\item
  How to label: use a pivot chord bracket!
\item
  Where will you (usually) find these?: in the middle of a phrase!
\end{itemize}

Make a chart of the chord functions, between two keys you are looking at, to
find the pivot chords easily.

\hypertarget{class-discussion-44}{%
\chapter{Class discussion}\label{class-discussion-44}}

\textbf{What do you think is a secondary leading tone of V?} - It's a vii0/V!
Stretched out, we would say it is vii0 in the key of V. (Remember slashes with
Roman numerals = ``of.'')

\textbf{Creating a V7/V} - Once we figured out our voicing, we changed the
V7/V to a vii0/V. This is possible because vii0 is just V7 without the root. -
We had a lot of problems trying to figure out which tone to double in vii0/V.
There's two tendency tones, and with the voicing we wrote out doubling the
third results in parallel octaves. Bad all around, just don't use
these\ldots use seventh chords instead

\textbf{Using a secondary leading-tone seventh chord} - You can use vii07 to
tonicize major or minor chords, but vii\%7 works \emph{only} with major
chords. If you try and tonicize a minor chord with vii\%7, things will get
really screwed up because of where all the voices want to resolve - When
trying to correctly resolve a vii07/V, it might be easier to think of the
regular vii07 solfege: ti re fa le. This will help you resolve the tendency
tones correctly into the next chord. Remember: all you're doing is thinking of
vii07 in the key of V.

\hypertarget{class-discussion-45}{%
\chapter{Class discussion}\label{class-discussion-45}}

\textbf{Circle-of-fifths triadic progression: I - vi - ii - V - I} - Static
movement in the melody is very good. It's exactly what we want because it can
make everything else a whole lot easier. Priotize static or stepwise movement
in the melody whenever you can - Build from the back. Since we're dealing with
a circle-of-fifths progression, we know exactly how tendency tones are going
to resolve and we can reverse-engineer the inner voices after we've written
our melody

\textbf{Adding the seventh: I - vi7 - ii - V7 - I} - Used the same boring
melody as before (C C D D C) because we have to K.I.S.S. - Really the best way
to do these is to write your melody from the front and fill in the inner
voices from the back - \emph{Frustrated leading tone}: can ONLY be used in the
inner voices. This happens when the leading tone resolves down by third to the
fifth of the next chord instead of going upward to the root. Ex: in C, in our
V the B in the tenor can go down to G on the next chord (I) if we really,
really want to have a fifth in there

\textbf{Short chord progressions, \#2: I - IV - V - vi} - Soprano line: C C B
C. There were a bunch of other options proposed that were at the same level of
simplicity (focus on smooth voice leading), but they all caused errors -
DOUBLE! THAT! THIRD! for a deceptive cadence. vi is a functional substitute
for I because of its position in a deceptive cadence. In this instance it
functions as the tonic instead of its usual ``pre-predominant.'' We double the
third because it's do/the tonic - Any time you use smooth contrary motion
you'll avoid the majority of movement errors

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``Circle of fifths progression'' = literal circle of fifths bass movement.
  This is our vi - ii - V - I. When we move I - IV - V - (etc\ldots) this is
  stepwise progression, so we can bend our tendency tone rules a little.
  Otherwise, our normal rules will create more problems.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Think about functional substitutes, too! IV is just a ii7 without the
    root. vii0 is just a V7 without a root. vi stands in for I in deceptive
    cadences. In the progression we did in class, temporarily changing IV to
    ii7 helped make clear why the A in our IV did not have to resolve how
    thirds usually do, since A is the fifth in ii7 and should follow the same
    voice leading rules
  \end{itemize}
\item
  vi6 is a NO. The do in the bass makes it sounds like this chord was supposed
  to be I instead, which is the opposite of what you want to do with a
  deceptive cadence
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Overall conclusions} - Frustrated leading tone is a get out of jail
free card in the inner voices ONLY - You can double the third for the vi in a
deceptive cadence

\textbf{Additional tips} - Check the outer voices for errors before filling in
the inner voices. If you catch errors early, you save yourself time

\hypertarget{harmonic-syntax}{%
\subsection{Harmonic syntax}\label{harmonic-syntax}}

\emph{Harmonic syntax} concerns the norms or principles according to which
harmonies (chords) are placed into meaningful successions. These norms include
progressions that are more or less common than others. Those norms generate
expectations for listeners familiar with the style: if \textbf{IV--V} is more
common than \textbf{IV--VI}, the appearance of a \textbf{IV} chord generates
an expectation that the next chord is more likely to be \textbf{V} than it is
to be \textbf{VI}.

In Western classical music, harmonies generally group into three
\emph{harmonic functions} --- tonic (T), pre-dominant (P), and dominant (D)
--- and these functions group together chords that progress to and from other
chords in similar ways. For example, since \textbf{II} and \textbf{IV} are
both pre-dominant chords, they will participate in many of the same kinds of
chord progressions, and at times can be substituted for each other with only a
minimal change to the musical effect.

On a local level (chord-to-chord progressions), we can summarize the
tendencies of these functions with the cycle \textbf{T--P--D--T}. That is,
harmonies tend to progress through a cyclical progression of those three
functions:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{T → P → D → T →} and so on . . .
\end{quote}

That does not rule out T progressing to D, D progressing to P, etc. But it
does mean that those progressions tend to be less common, at least in
classical music.

Higher-level musical structures also impact the norms according to which these
harmonic functions progress. For now, we will consider one higher-level
structure that influences chord-progression tendencies --- the phrase --- and
we will limit our study to isolated, complete, self-sufficient phrases. This
is an idealized, oversimplified setting --- like strict voice-leading --- that
is useful for learning the basics. Some such phrases even exist in real music!
But most of the time there are a number of competing factors that influence
the chord-progression strategies employed by a composer at any given moment.
However, the idealized phrase is a helpful starting point. Future study will
explore how classical composers employ harmonic progressions in larger musical
works that combine multiple phrases (which are not self-sufficient) into
larger themes and movements.

\hypertarget{the-idealized-phrase-1}{%
\subsection{The idealized phrase}\label{the-idealized-phrase-1}}

The \emph{idealized phrase} (also called the \emph{phrase model}) is a single
musical phrase that progresses through an entire cycle of harmonic functions,
beginning and ending on tonic. (Strict voice-leading exercises are such
phrases.) These phrases begin with a point of stability (tonic), move away
from that stable point, and then eventually lead to a point of high tension
and resolution (an \emph{authentic cadence}). This pattern of
stability--instability--stability, or rest--motion--rest, with a single goal
at the end, should be familiar both from species counterpoint and from strict
keyboard-style voice-leading. (This pattern also governs large-scale formal
structures in classical music.)

The simplest phrase that exhibits this complete harmonic cycle is a
tonic-dominant-tonic progression: \textbf{I--V--I.} This phrase begins and
ends with the most stable harmony (\textbf{I}), and includes an
\emph{authentic cadence} (\textbf{V--I}). The \textbf{V} is the high point of
instability, containing the tendency tone (\emph{ti}) that most strongly
points to the final point of arrival (\emph{do}, or tonic).

This harmonic cycle can be expanded by inserting a pre-dominant chord, a
destabilized tonic chord, or both, as in the following examples:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{I IV V I}\\
\textbf{I II V I}\\
\textbf{I VI V I}\\
\textbf{I VI II V I}
\end{quote}

In \emph{functional bass} terms, any harmonic progression that follows the
pattern

\begin{quote}
\textbf{T1 → (P\_) → D5 → T1}
\end{quote}

can serve as the basis for a complete idealized phrase. (Harmonies in
parentheses are optional.)

Phrases are seldom 3--5 chords long, however, and a harmonic function can be
expressed by more than a single chord. Thus we can understand the harmonic
functions not simply as chords, but as \emph{zones} of varying length in a
phrase, which can be created by a number of chords or short chord
progressions. More generally, then, our idealized musical phrase contains a
single progression of functional zones \textbf{T → (P) → D → T}, begins with
\textbf{T1}, and ends with an authentic cadence (\textbf{D5--T1}), as seen in
the example below.

\hypertarget{triggering-and-prolonging-harmonic-functions-in-an-idealized-phrase-1}{%
\subsection{Triggering and prolonging harmonic functions in an idealized
phrase}\label{triggering-and-prolonging-harmonic-functions-in-an-idealized-phrase-1}}

To establish, or trigger, a harmonic functional zone, composers tend to use
\emph{a fixed scale degree in the bass}. In other words, tonic tends to be
triggered by \textbf{T1} (always \textbf{I}), pre-dominant by \textbf{S2} or
\textbf{S4} (including a variety of \textbf{II} and \textbf{IV} chords, in in
root position or inversions, with and without sevenths), and dominant by
\textbf{D5} (\textbf{V}, with or without a seventh, or a
\href{cadenceTypes}{\emph{compound cadence}}). These four categories of chords
--- \textbf{T1}, \textbf{P2}, \textbf{P4}, and \textbf{D5} --- are called
\emph{functional chords} (because they trigger the function) or
\emph{cadential chords} (because they can participate in a cadence).

Other chords are often called \emph{contrapuntal chords} or \emph{embellishing
chords}, and are typically used to \emph{prolong} a function throughout the
zone.

Functional prolongations are shown in a harmonic analysis by writing/typing T,
P, or D underneath the individual chord labels (Roman numerals or functional
bass) and extending a line from the beginning of the functional zone to the
end.

The following excerpt is from Mozart's Piano Sonata in A Major, K. 331, I.,
mm. 1--4, with a harmonic reduction and analysis provided below the original
score. Such an analysis is called an \emph{interpreted} harmonic analysis,
because the harmonies are interpreted according to the way they behave in the
phrase, rather than merely labeled. In this phrase, note the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The tonic zone is triggered by a root-position tonic triad (\textbf{I} or
  \textbf{T1}).\\
\item
  Contrapuntal dominant chords (\textbf{D7} --- first-inversion dominant
  chords) create a passing bass motion between the opening \textbf{I} chord,
  the \textbf{vi} in m. 3, and the return of \textbf{I} in m. 4.
\item
  The \href{harmonicAnalysis}{cadential progression} begins in m. 4 with the
  move from \textbf{I} to ii6 (\textbf{S4}) and then to the cadential six-four
  and dominant triad (\textbf{D5}). Note that the entirety of the cadential
  progression in m. 4 is made up of \emph{cadential chords} --- chords with
  fixed scale degrees in the bass.\\
\item
  In contrast, the entire tonic-prolongation zone is made up of
  \emph{contrapuntal chords} --- variable scale degrees in the bass --- with
  the exception of the \textbf{I} chord that triggered the tonic function.\\
\item
  The \textbf{vi} chord is a root-position chord, but still an embellishing
  chord, while the ii6 is an inverted chord, but still a functional/cadential
  chord. The difference is not the inversion, but the scale degree of the
  bass.
\end{itemize}

\href{/images/harmony/k331-reduction.png}{\includegraphics{/images/harmony/k331-reduction.png}}

Not all classical phrases as neatly fit the general trends outlined in this
resource. As discussed in \href{tendency}{Style and tendency}, the principles
of harmonic syntax are both reliable and bendable/breakable, and it is often
the music that bends/breaks the ``rules'' in interesting ways that we care
about the most. So in your own analyses, keep these principles in mind as
\emph{general} principles, and simultaneously look for where composers meet
these expectations as well as where they break them.

\hypertarget{prolonging-harmonic-functions}{%
\section{Prolonging harmonic functions}\label{prolonging-harmonic-functions}}

The following are the primary techniques used to prolong functional zones in
an idealized classical phrase. Examples of specific progressions and
notational conventions are provided.

\hypertarget{change-of-figure-prolongation}{%
\subsection{Change-of-figure
prolongation}\label{change-of-figure-prolongation}}

A \emph{change-of-figure prolongation} occurs when the bass repeats (or is
sustained, or drops an octave) while one or more of the upper voices change.
The function remains the same (T/P/D), but the Roman numeral may change.

Examples include progressions like \textbf{V--V7} (both \textbf{D5}) or
\textbf{IV--II6} (both \textbf{P4}).

\hypertarget{change-of-bass-prolongation}{%
\subsection{Change-of-bass prolongation}\label{change-of-bass-prolongation}}

A \emph{change-of-bass prolongation} occurs when two chords of the same
function appear back-to-back, but with different bass pitch classes. In some
cases, these are changes of inversion: \textbf{I--I6}, for example. In other
cases, the root changes: \textbf{I--III} or \textbf{IV--II}, for example. What
makes these progressions prolongations is that the function remains the same.
\textbf{I--I6} prolongs tonic function (\textbf{T1--T3}), and \textbf{IV--II}
prolongs pre-dominant function (\textbf{P4--P2}).

\hypertarget{contrapuntal-prolongation-passing-chord}{%
\subsection{Contrapuntal prolongation -- passing
chord}\label{contrapuntal-prolongation-passing-chord}}

Many change-of-bass prolongations involve a skip of a third in the bass, such
as \textbf{I--I6} (\textbf{T1--T3}). Just as in second-species counterpoint a
melodic third from downbeat to downbeat invites the use of a weak-beat passing
tone, a melodic third in the bass between these two chords invites the use of
a \emph{passing chord}.

The bass note of a passing chord will fill in the third with stepwise motion.
The melody will also often contain passing motion.

A function is typically prolonged by contrapuntal chords belonging to the
function that precedes it in the standard cycle. T is prolonged by D, D by P,
and P by T.

A passing chord that prolongs the above \textbf{T1--T3} progression would then
be a dominant chord (D precedes T) with scale-degree 2 in the bass (the
passing tone between scale degrees 1 and 3): \textbf{D2}.

Common \textbf{D2} chords are \textbf{V6/4}, \textbf{V4/3}, and \textbf{VII6}.
Thus, a \textbf{I--I6} prolongation can involve those as passing chords. The
following \textbf{T1 D2 T3} progression uses a \textbf{viiº6} to prolong
tonic. Listen to this example, and then try to change the progression to a
properly voiced \textbf{I V6/4 I6} progression.

Note that while scale-degree 2 in the bass can support a \textbf{II} chord,
\textbf{II} is pre-dominant, and so it is \emph{not} used as a passing chord
to prolong tonic.

\hypertarget{contrapuntal-prolongation-incomplete-neighbor-chord}{%
\subsection{Contrapuntal prolongation -- incomplete neighbor
chord}\label{contrapuntal-prolongation-incomplete-neighbor-chord}}

In \href{secondSpecies.html}{second-species counterpoint}, variety could come
by using a \emph{substitution} in place of a passing tone. This leap of a
fourth followed by step in the opposite direction still outlines a third from
downbeat to downbeat, but offers a break from too much stepwise motion in the
counterpoint.

In harmonic writing, the same effect is obtained by an \emph{incomplete
neighbor chord}. The bass follows the same incomplete-neighbor pattern as the
second-species counterpoint, and the function of the contrapuntal chord is the
same as its passing-chord counterpart. Thus instead of a passing motion of
\textbf{T1 D2 T3}, a substitution pattern in the bass would produce \textbf{T1
D4 T3}. (In Roman numerals, that progression would almost invariably be
\textbf{I V4/2 I6}, as it is in the following example.)

\hypertarget{contrapuntal-prolongation-complete-neighbor-chord}{%
\subsection{Contrapuntal prolongation -- complete neighbor
chord}\label{contrapuntal-prolongation-complete-neighbor-chord}}

Just as a \emph{neighbor tone} in second- or third-species counterpoint could
be used to ornament a single tone and return to it, a \emph{neighbor chord}
uses a neighbor-tone motion in the bass to prolong a function and return to
the original bass pitch. The function of a neighbor chord follows the same
principle as the passing or incomplete neighbor chord. Following are some
examples of neighbor-chord prolongations:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{T1 D7 T1}\\
\item

Here is a \textbf{T1 D7 T1} neighbor prolongation in strict keyboard style.
What is the Roman numeral and figured bass for the \textbf{D7} chord? What is
the least number of changes you can make to it in order to transform it into
\textbf{T3 D4 T3}?

Just as third-species counterpoint has a \emph{double neighbor} figure,
harmonies can be prolonged by two chords using a double-neighbor figure in the
bass. The most common double-neighbor prolongation is \textbf{T1 D2 D7 T1}
(commonly \textbf{I V4/3 V6/5 I}).

\hypertarget{contrapuntal-prolongation---divider-and-embellishing-chords}{%
\subsection{Contrapuntal prolongation - divider and embellishing
chords}\label{contrapuntal-prolongation---divider-and-embellishing-chords}}

In second-species counterpoint, an \emph{interval subdivision} divided a large
leap between downbeats into two smaller leaps. Likewise, a \emph{divider
chord} takes a large leap between bass notes in a change-of-bass prolongation
(or a simple octave leap in the bass) and divides it into two smaller leaps.

Divider chords almost always prolong tonic function, and can do so using
either pre-dominant or dominant dividers. The most common divider-chord
prolongations are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{T1 D5 T1} (\textbf{I V(7) I}), where the bass ascends or descends an
  octave between \textbf{T1} chords.\\
\item
  \textbf{T1 P4 T1} (\textbf{I IV I}), where the bass ascends or descends an
  octave between \textbf{T1} chords.\\
\item
  \textbf{T1 P6 T3} (\textbf{I IV6 I6} or \textbf{I IV6 III}), dubbed the
  \emph{champagne progression} by theorist Gene Biringer, because it is ``the
  progression you pull out when you want to impress a date.''
\end{itemize}

Following is a champagne progression. Which version is it (\textbf{I6} or
\textbf{III})? What one thing must change in order to form the other version?
What default voice-leading rule is ``broken'' in this progression? (Note,
because of rule conflicts, this progression will always break that rule, and
it will always have these scale degrees in the melody.)

In the case of \textbf{T1 D5 T1} and \textbf{T1 P4 T1}, the same harmonic
progression can occur without the bass changing register. In other words, the
bass leaps from \emph{do} to \emph{sol} or \emph{fa}, but returns to the
original bass note. Instead of dividing a large leap, the bass note of the
intervening chord looks like an \emph{embellishing tone} from third species.
(In third-species counterpoint, an \emph{embellishing tone} ornaments another
tone by leaping to another consonance --- usually a third or fourth away ---
and returning to the original tone.) Thus, what would otherwise be a
\emph{divider chord} is instead an \emph{embellishing chord}.

Following is a \textbf{T1 D5 T1} \emph{divider} prolongation. What single
change can make it an \emph{embellishing chord} prolongation?

\hypertarget{subsidiary-harmonic-progressions}{%
\subsection{Subsidiary harmonic
progressions}\label{subsidiary-harmonic-progressions}}

The last type of prolongation is not contrapuntal, but instead involves weak
versions of the typical \textbf{T--(P)--D--T} progression. When such a
progression fails to produce a proper cadence --- that is, it ends with
contrapuntal chords such as \textbf{D7--T1} or \textbf{D4--T3}, or uses a
``deceptive resolution'' \textbf{D5--T6} (\textbf{V--VI}) in place of the
cadential \textbf{D5--T1} --- the progression is called a \emph{subsidiary
harmonic progression} (this term comes from Edward Aldwell \& Carl Schachter;
Steven Laitz calls the same progression an \emph{embedded phrase model}). It
is ``subsidiary'' (or ``embedded'') because instead of occupying the whole
phrase, it is subsidiary to (or embedded in) a larger progression.

These subsidiary progressions \emph{always prolong tonic}. They are labeled in
an analysis by following the initial T with a line:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{T---------------}
\end{quote}

For instance, consider the following possible harmonic progression for a
phrase:

The first progression through the \textbf{T--S--D--T} cycle does not produce a
cadence when it returns to T. However, it cannot be said to be a contrapuntal
prolongation because it follows the normal functional cycle perfectly. Thus,
it is a subsidiary progression.

\href{/images/harmony/subsidiaryProgression.png}{\includegraphics{/images/harmony/subsidiaryProgression.png}}

\hypertarget{plagal-progressions}{%
\subsection{Plagal progressions}\label{plagal-progressions}}

As a rule, \textbf{T} is used for contrapuntal prolongation of \textbf{P},
\textbf{P} prolongs \textbf{D}, and \textbf{D} prolongs \textbf{T}. However,
there are some common patterns in which \textbf{P} is used to prolong
\textbf{T}.

The \emph{champagne progression} (\textbf{I--IV6--I6} or \textbf{I--IV6--III})
is one. Another is the \textbf{P4} divider, as well as the related \textbf{P4}
embellishing chord. All are described above.

One other common pattern is to use \textbf{IV} (\textbf{P}) as a complete or
incomplete neighbor to \textbf{I6} (\textbf{T}). Common progressions include
\textbf{I IV I6} and \textbf{I6 IV I6}.

Also common is a \emph{change-of-figure} prolongation of \textbf{T1}:
I--IV6/4--I. The IV6/4 can be considered an \textbf{P} chord, but it is often
more appropriate simply to consider the sixth and fourth above the bass in
that chord to be neighbor tones to the fifth and third. Simply label such a
progression \textbf{T---------} underneath the Roman numerals.

\hypertarget{prolonging-a-progression}{%
\subsection{Prolonging a progression}\label{prolonging-a-progression}}

Occasionally, a contrapuntal chord is used not to prolong a single function,
but to connect chords of different functions --- in other words, to prolong a
progression.

The most common occurrence is when a bass line moves down by step from
\emph{do} to \emph{sol}, which is especially common in minor. The bass line
\emph{do}--\emph{te}--\emph{le}--\emph{sol} is harmonized by \textbf{T1 D7 P6
D5} (usually \textbf{i v6 iv6 V} --- the chord qualities are important in this
progression, called the ``lament''). In this progression, the \textbf{P6} is a
functional pre-dominant leading to the cadential \textbf{D5}. The \textbf{D7}
chord, then, is simply a passing chord that connects \textbf{T1} with
\textbf{P6}. To notate this, draw and arrow between \textbf{T} and \textbf{P}
underneath the Roman numeral analysis.

In second-species counterpoint, the counterpoint line moves in half notes
against a cantus firmus in whole notes. This 2:1 rhythmic ratio leads to two
new ``fundamental musical problems'' -- one metric and one harmonic: - the
differentiation between \emph{strong beats} and \emph{weak beats} - the
introduction of the \emph{passing tone} dissonance.

The introduction of harmonic dissonance into second species adds to the
variety of the musical texture. However, it brings a tension that must be
balanced with consonance to promote a cohesive tonal progression, and it
requires careful attention in order to maintain smoothness in and out of the
dissonance.

If we consider first-species counterpart the most ``basic'' interaction
between two melodies, adding this second note against a harmony also provides
an opportunity to begin discussing the shapes and patterns that composers use
to embellish a simple melody.

\hypertarget{goals-for-this-topic-11}{%
\section{Goals for this topic}\label{goals-for-this-topic-11}}

Use the following examples of second-species (2:1) counterpoint to develop
guidelines for writing in this style. Each of the following examples is in the
major mode and has the counterpoint above the cantus firmus, but again, be
aware that these two characteristics are not indicative of all counterpoint;
we are using a simplified structure as our introduction.

\textbf{As you develop your rules for second-species counterpoint, look only
at the \emph{counterpoint (CP)} line; the \emph{cantus firmus (CF)} was
provided, so the counterpoint line was written by following the stylistic
rules.}

Generally, your rules should be divided into three categories: - Acceptable
\emph{harmonic intervals (intervals between lines)} - Strong beats versus weak
beats - Are dissonances viable? If so, when? - Starting and ending intervals -
Approaching the final pitch - Approaching and leaving perfect intervals -
Number of times that an interval size can be used consecutively -
Differentiate between perfect and imperfect consonances - Constructing a
\emph{melodic line} - Length - Starting and ending pitches - Approaching the
final note - Repeated pitches - Melodic intervals - Leaps - Resolutions
following leaps - How would you describe the motion surrounding any dissonant
intervals? - Range - Climax (position in melody and frequency) - Acceptable
\emph{motion between lines} - Acceptable types of motion

\hypertarget{second-species-counterpoint}{%
\subsection{Second Species Counterpoint}\label{second-species-counterpoint}}

Instead of the 1:1 ratio in first species between pitches of the cantus firmus
and counterpoint, second species has a 2:1 ratio--most often notated as two
half notes for every one whole note. This creates a pattern of strong and weak
beats and consequently a series of rules that are defined by the contrapuntal
place in the measure.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Strong beats occur ``on the beat,'' meaning that they align with every
  change of pitch in the cantus firmus.
\item
  Weak beats are ``off the beat'' meaning that they occur in the middle of
  each pitch in the cantus firmus.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{harmonic-intervals}{%
\subsection{Harmonic Intervals:}\label{harmonic-intervals}}

Second species counterpoint also allows for a key element that is not an
option in first species: dissonance. Strong beats must still only use
consonances. Weak beats may use dissonance, although there are many
restrictions.

For our studies, we will start the counterpoint with a rest on the strong beat
followed by a perfect interval on the weak beat. From that point forward, you
will follow these harmonic rules:

Consonances: - may occur at any point - strong beats will always be consonant
- imperfect consonances are generally preferred because they do not cause
issues when used in parallel motion

Dissonances: - only on weak beats - approached by step

Starting and Ending Intervals: - starts on P5, P8, or unison - ends on P5 or
P8

Perfect Intervals - approached by parallel motion - same perfect interval
(e.g.~P5 to P5) can never occur consecutively, nor can they occur on
consecutive strong beats

\hypertarget{motion-between-lines}{%
\subsection{Motion Between Lines}\label{motion-between-lines}}

In discussing counterpoint, you may have noticed that the restricted melodic
options create a variety of ``standard'' melodic shapes. We can describe a few
of these here, and this will be explored fully when we begin studying
non-chord tones in diatonic harmony in Unit 9.

\textbf{passing motion} (P): motion approached by step and left by step in the
same direction

\textbf{neighboring motion} (N): motion approached by step and left by step in
the opposite direction

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Note that these neighboring and passing motion are the only types of motion
  that allow you to use dissonant intervals in second species counterpoint.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Dissonance using neighboring motion is only allowed using a lower
    neighbor, never an upper neighbor.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{appoggiatura} (APP): motion approached by leap and left by step in the
opposite direction

Now that we have the tools to understand and classify harmonies, we can
analyze almost any piece of music written using the diatonic system. Of
course, analysis implies a deeper understanding than simply labeling chords,
but to begin this process, we must start with that basic idea.

When looking at a piece of music, the first step to labeling chords must be to
sort which tones are functional and which are embellishments. The non-chord
tones described in the previous topic can be combined with our rudimentary
knowledge of common chord progressions in order to help in this
differentiation. As always, chorales are the easiest place to begin
understanding these patterns, but these principles can be applied to any piece
of diatonic music because these non-chord tones reflect the patterns necessary
to navigate tertiary harmony.

In short, creating harmony from stacked thirds produces a limited number of
functional melodic patterns. Non-chord tones help us identify these.

\hypertarget{examples-2}{%
\section{Examples}\label{examples-2}}

TBD

We have now studied the full array of part-writing errors for four-part
chorale style compositions. Because there are so many possible errors, it can
feel overwhelming to begin looking for errors, and it is easy to miss errors
in long examples. I have developed a method for systematically identifying
part-writing errors, and it not only helps to limit errors, it also helps
students to understand the vertical and horizontal interactions that create
part-writing errors.

Follow the steps from the list below when searching for errors. The next page
gives specific examples of how to use this methodology for numbers 5 through
8.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Voice-crossing}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Exception: alto and tenor may cross briefly if musically necessary
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Spacing}: In a four-part texture, are the top three voices within an
  octave of the adjacent voices?
\item
  \emph{Range}
\item
  \emph{Doubling}
\item
  \emph{Similar 5ths and 8ves}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Follow the soprano line looking for leaps
  \item
    When a leap is found, look to see if there is similar motion in the bass
    (not parallel)
  \item
    Determine the interval between the outer voices of the second chord. - If
    this interval is either a P5 or P8, there is a similar 5th or 8ve.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Parallel Perfect 5ths and 8ves}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Determine the interval between each pitch horizontally (melodically -- NOT
    within each chord (vertically)
  \item
    If one of the new vertical stacks of four intervals (numbers only)
    contains two matching numbers, check to see if the intervals within each
    chord (vertically) are P5s or P8s.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      With triads, P5s must always have the root of the chord on the bottom of
      a major or minor chord. No other combination or chord can produce a P5.
    \item
      P8s must come from doubled voices moving to doubled voices
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    If there are two consecutive P5s or P8s, those are parallel 5ths or 8ves.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Unacceptable Unequal 5ths}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Should be found while looking for parallel 5ths using same method as
    above.
  \item
    When completing step 2, if a d5 moves to a P5 and it involves the bass
    line, this is unacceptable unequal 5ths
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Contrary Perfect 5th and 8ves}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    After the first part of the parallel perfect 5ths/8ves instructions, look
    for inverted pairs of numbers (e.g.~2 and 7, 3 and 6, 4 and 5) within each
    number stack
  \item
    If one of the new vertical stacks contains one of these inversion pairs,
    check to see if the intervals within each chord (vertically) are P5s or
    P8s.
  \item
    With triads, P5s must always have the root of the chord on the bottom of a
    major or minor chord. No other combination or chord can produce a P5.
  \item
    P8s must come from doubled voices moving to doubled voices
  \item
    If there are two consecutive P5s or P8s, those are contrary 5ths or 8ves.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

We have already practiced finding errors in voicing: 1. \emph{Voice-crossing}
- Exception: alto and tenor may cross briefly if musically necessary 2.
\emph{Spacing}: In a four-part texture, are the top three voices within an
octave of the adjacent voices? 3. \emph{Range} 4. \emph{Doubling}

Finding part-writing errors is considerably more time-consuming, and it can be
easy to miss errors if you do not approach it systematically. I have created a
system that uses horizontal intervals to make it simpler and more consistent
to find the four major part-writing errors. Use the examples below to explore
the concepts, and then apply these on your homework.

\hypertarget{finding-similar-fifths-and-octaves}{%
\section{Finding similar fifths and
octaves}\label{finding-similar-fifths-and-octaves}}

As mentioned in the previous topic, the restrictive rules of \emph{similar
fifths and octaves} make these the simplest of the part-writing errors to
find.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Similar 5ths and 8ves}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Follow the soprano line looking for skip of a 3rd or more
  \item
    When a skip is found, look to see if there is similar motion in the bass
    (not parallel)
  \item
    Determine the interval between the outer voices of the second chord. - If
    this interval is either a P5 or P8, there is a similar 5th or 8ve.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Given his ability, it is safe to assume that he did this intentionally, so our
goal is not to judge whether his part-writing was correct, only to see if you
can use the methods above to find the error. He also chose to cross voices for
a moment, but this is intentional and hidden in the inner voices.

NOTE: When one voice moves more quickly than the others, you must compare the
intervals created on \emph{both} sides to the vertical stacks of the other
three voices.

Error Checklist and Guide}

When we practice voice-leading, we are really studying melodic intervals, the
horizontal aspect of music. And because all part-writing errors are symptoms
of poor voice-leading, this method finds part-writing errors by systematically
comparing at the melodic intervals within each voice. It can be difficult at
first to understand the method when only reading about it, but if you take the
time to walk through each step above, you should be able to understand the
process. It should not only teach you to identify the motion and tendencies
behind the errors, but it also ensures that you will have a way to
consistently double-check your work.

This video does a great job of explaining the concept of mode mixture, but as
he mentioned near the end of the video, he is only ``scratching the surface.''
Having watched the video, you probably feel that you understand the extended
\emph{concept} of mode mixture, but if you were asked to compose a progression
and melody the incorporated mode mixture, do you feel that you would be able
to implement it? Where would you start? In short, this video explains the
``what is it?'' but it does not begin to approach the ``why it works?'' or
``how it works?''

To begin exploring this, use the score below to try voicing one of the
progressions taken from the video. Take risks, and break the ``rules'' as you
try this. You must use the chord progression below, but you may alter the bass
and soprano lines if you would like. You may also add as many or as few of the
pitches as you need. Are you able to make this progression sound as pleasing
as it does in the video? If not, what are the factors making this difficult?
From a technical viewpoint, is it lack of knowledge or is it the medium (MIDI
keyboard)? From a musical viewpoint, what aspects make the biggest improvement
when you alter them?

Even though this is an entirely new style of progression, you can focus on the
fundamentals of voice-leading to guide you. For example: - Resolve tendency
tones correctly - Write smooth individual voices - Allow more spacing in your
voices when writing in the lowest range - Avoid objectional parallels when
possible - Don't double tendency tones

If you do these things, it is fairly easy to write a smooth soprano line and
then work your way backward through the progression to create something such
as this:

\hypertarget{functional-mode-mixture}{%
\section{Functional mode mixture}\label{functional-mode-mixture}}

As you have hopefully come to realize, all tonal harmony -- even the chromatic
alterations -- rely on voice-leading to create a sense of natural progression,
and each harmony can be viewed through the lens of how it functions. From
this, we derive primary harmonic functions such as tonic, dominant, and
pre-dominant as well as embellishing functions such as passing, pedal, and
cadential. Even the exceptions to these can be viewed as functional
substitutions (e.g.~deceptive progressions).

At its core, mode mixture borrows altered tones from parallel modes -- thus
altering chord \emph{qualities} -- but retains standard chord function. If a
diatonic chord would have a pre-dominant function, altering an individual tone
by a half-step will not alter the function. It creates color and often
\emph{strengthens} the voice-leading by changing whole-step resolutions into
half-step resolutions. Moreover, if a chord functions as an embellishing chord
such as a passing or pedal chord, then it will retain that function even if
one or two pitches are borrowed from a parallel mode.

Even seemingly inexplicable choices can be explained -- such as the iiø7 from
the chord progression above -- if you look at the voice-leading and compare it
to standard diatonic function. 1. The iiø7 is inserted into the position where
we would normally expect a dominant function. 2. If you compare the pitches
within iiø7 to the pitches of viio7, you will realize that three of the
pitches are the same (D, F, and A-flat) and the remaining pitch only changes
by a half-step (B to C). In this progression, the C works best when it acts as
an anticipation of the tonic chord, and this strengthens the voice-leading
resolutions of iiø7. Therefore, the iiø7 can be viewed as an altered dominant
function chord.

With this in mind, look at the following reduction of an excerpt from Mahler's
Symphony No.~2. How would you explain each of these borrowed chords? How do
they function? Is this similar to the progression from above?

Each Beat 4 of the first four measures of this passage has a colorful chord
that contrasts the stateliness of the C major triad of the first three beats.
In measure 1, the B-natural against the B-flat is not a typo; this dissonance
is intentional. If you listen to the right-hand of this reduction alone, you
will hear a clear descending melody in which the borrowed B-flat begins the
\texttt{te} - \texttt{le} - \texttt{sol} melodic tendency that we associate
with melodic minor.

Underneath that B-flat, however, is B diminished triad, and when the B-flat
moves downward to the A-flat, we hear a a clear borrowed viio7, which makes
the B-flat an appogiatura. This figure is repeated down an octave in measure
4.

Measures 2 and 3 follow the same pattern of placing a non-chord tone on beat
4, followed by descending stepwise motion into a chord tone. In this case
though, the resulting chord is a D-flat major triad. While we could consider
this further mode mixture as a borrowed II chord from the Phrygian mode, it
will be easier to wait until the next Unit to discuss Neapolitan chords.

\hypertarget{conclusions-52}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-52}}

Chromatic passing tones often create harmonies that could be considered
borrowed chords, but the determining factor should always be its function. If
the resulting borrowed chord does not sound as a defined function (e.g.~tonic,
dominant, pedal, etc.), then the pitch should be classified as a passing tone.
If the chord operates as a functional substitution (tonic, dominant,
pre-dominant), then it is better to label it as a borrowed chord. If each
member of the chord functions solely for smooth voice-leading purposes, then
it should be labeled as a borrowed chord with an alternate function such as a
passing or pedal chord.

In the example above, most will hear the first iteration as a I-IV-iv-I
progression. The chromatic tone of the iv chord on beat 3 is present for the
entirety of the beat and fits the harmonic rhythm of one chord per quarter
note. Considering beats 2 and 3 as one chord would allow you to label the
A-flat as a chromatic passing tone, but the A-flat is present long enough to
make this difficult to hear as such. Conversely, the A-flat in the second
measure is only present for an eighth note and occurs in a weak position. In
this case, the A-flat is a clear chromatic passing tone and would not be
labeled as a borrowed iv chord.

In Unit 17, we will discuss how repeated patterns and sequences in
voice-leading can override standard voice-leading practices. We can preview
one such example by looking at seventh chords that require ``incorrectly''
resolved chordal thirds and sevenths. To demonstrate this, harmonize the
excerpt below paying attention to the chordal resolutions between the ii7 and
V4/3 chords. Which voices must use non-standard resolutions to accommodate the
progression?

In order to use complete chords, the chordal third of the ii7 chord must
remain static to become the chordal seventh of the V7 like so:

Because secondary dominant chords are so closely related to diatonic
circle-of-fifths progressions, you may apply the same principle to repeated
series of secondary dominant seventh chords. Try the same voice-leading on the
following example. What changes? How does this affect accidentals within the
bar.

You may keep the same resolutions that you used in the diatonic example
above--the chordal third of the first chord becomes the chordal seventh of the
following chord. The static motion in the alto voice is altered though,
because you must resolve down by half-step now that the chordal third has been
raised.

Unsurprisingly, this concept can be extended to encompass the entirety of the
diatonic circle-of-fifths progression. Begin by harmonizing the following
standard progression.

This progression is nearly identical to the progression we used in Unit 14 to
introduce secondary dominant chords by altering the ii chord. We then altered
the vi chord from the same progression in Unit 15a in order to demonstrate
tonicization of chords other than V. Because the voice-leading is so similar,
secondary dominant functions can lead into \emph{each other} creating series
of secondary dominant chords. In the example above, alter your voicing of the
ii7 chord to create a V7/V chord and alter the vi7 chord to create a V7/ii
creating a progression of:

I - V7/ii - V7/V - V7 - I

\hypertarget{conclusions-53}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-53}}

This progression now simply extends your seventh chord resolutions from the
examples above, although the fixed soprano line forces you to use an
incomplete chord on your V7/ii.

functions}\label{deceptive-resolutions-of-secondary-dominant-functions}}

There is a less common resolution of secondary dominant chords that relies on
the voice-leading from a deceptive cadence. Analyze the following example, and
you will notice that at first glance, the progression does not follow our
established progressions between the second and third chords. To understand
this, you must think in the \emph{tonicized} key. What key would this
chromatic chord \emph{normally} tonicize? If you were in that key, how would
label the progression between these two chords? It is helpful to use leadsheet
symbols here.

\hypertarget{conclusions-54}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-54}}

In this progression, the E7 chord is likely to function as the dominant in the
key of A major/minor. But instead of resolving to an A minor chord--the
diatonic vi of the current key of C major--it resolves to an F major triad. At
first this seems almost nonsensical, but if you examine the tonicization in
the key of A minor, you will realize that this is a common progression in that
key--a deceptive progression of V7 to VI. In labeling this in our secondary
key, you do not need to label anything further, but feel free to use the
abbreviation of ``dec'' in parentheses between the two chords if you would
like to make a note of this uncommon use of secondary dominants.

In short, if you find a root-position secondary dominant chord that does not
resolve to its normally tonicized chord, check to see if it instead resolves
to a diatonic chord with a root that is a step (M2/m2) above the root of the
secondary dominant. If so, this is a deceptive resolution in a secondary key,
so you should still label the secondary dominant in the secondary key.

Remember that all deceptive progressions create difficult voice leading in
four-part harmony, particularly if both chords are triads. Please refer to the
voice-leading guidelines for this progression in Unit 11 if you would like to
review.

\hypertarget{conclusions-55}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-55}}

We first hear the modulation on the second beat of the fifth measure. The B
diminished triad is not diatonic to the original key of B-flat major but
becomes the viio chord of the new key of C minor. If you try to find a common
chord pivot by looking at the chord before the modulation point (the place
where you first hear the modulation), you will notice that the F major chord
works in B-flat major, but not in the new key of C minor in which F minor is
the diatonic iv chord.

Even though there is no common chord pivot available, this excerpt still
relies on the voice-leading and a functional progression to modulate. The
listener expects the F major triad (m.5, beat 1) to resolve to a B-flat triad.
Instead, Bach alters one pitch from the B-flat triad turning the B-flat triad
into a B diminished triad, and thereby creates a pivot on a secondary
function. This is a \emph{secondary function pivot modulation}.

We label these using the same bracket system that we use for common chord
pivot modulations, but one or both of the chords will be a secondary function.
In this case, the top part of the bracket will contain ``viio6/ii,'' and the
bottom part will containing ``c: viio6.''

Because you first hear the modulation on beat 4 of the measure 2, it would
make sense to pivot on the previous chord (the fermata), an E major triad.
Pivoting on this chord would give you a modulation bracket with a ``I'' on top
and ``c\#: III'' on bottom. The issue is that the modulation point is a
B-sharp diminished triad, which is the iio6 in the key of C-sharp minor.
III-ii not a diatonically functional progression, so this is not a pivot chord
modulation.

The crucial factor for this modulation is that it occurs across two phrases.
The first phrase clearly ends on an IAC in E major, and the following chord
immediately begins the new key. A modulation that relies on the phrase is
called a \emph{direct modulation} or \emph{phrase modulation}.

Because there is no pivot chord in these types of modulations, we label direct
modulations without a bracket. Simply put the upper- or lower-case letter for
the new key followed by a colon and the first chord in the new key. For this
excerpt, the Roman numeral for beat 4 of the measure 2 would be:
\emph{c\#:iio6}.

Because direct modulations are the only modulations we label without a
bracket, you should know that if you choose to label a modulation that is not
a direct modulation without using a modulation bracket, someone reading your
analysis will assume that you misunderstood the modulation.

The last type of common modulation relies on a non-harmonic principle. Look at
the following excerpt from a Schubert Lied. This is noticeably more advanced
harmonic language than anything we have studied to this point, so there are
certain harmonies (e.g.~beat 2 of measure 2, beat 1 of measure 6) that we will
not study until a later unit. As you listen to this however, you should have a
strong sense of D minor until the dramatic modulation in measure 10. What ties
the two chords in measure 10 together? If you need help, try isolating the
voice part by deleting the piano staves. (To do this quickly, delete
everything from \texttt{V:2}and below in the textbox. You can hit the

\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-57}}

The excerpt begins in D minor but modulates to F-sharp major by the end. These
are distantly related keys, so a common chord pivot modulation would be
difficult. Instead, Schubert emphasizes a particular common tone in the melody
and upper voice of the piano: the C-sharp. This pitch is the seventh scale
degree in D minor and the fifth scale degree in F-sharp major.

By accentuating a particular pitch that is common to two keys, a composer can
bridge seemingly impossible gaps in the tonal language. In this particular
example, the C-sharp was accentuated by placing prominently in the melody, but
composers will often take this a step further and completely isolate the pitch
without any accompaniment. Regardless of texture, a common-tone modulation
functions by emphasizing a particular pitch.

\textbf{To label a common-tone modulation}, we use a bracket similar to a
pivot modulation. Instead of using chord symbols, however, we use scale
degrees. For the Schubert common-tone modulation above, the top of the bracket
would contain ``\^{}7,'' and the bottom of the bracket would contain
``F\#:\^{}5.'' (Remember that when writing the scale degree ``caret mark,''
you should place the caret \emph{above} the numeral, not beside it as shown in
an online text such as this.)

Some modulations may fall into more than one of these categories. In these
cases, let your ear be the deciding factor. Focus on the basic premise of each
modulation and decide which most closely describes your perception of the
composer's intent.

Pitch-class integer notation and the two primary forms of manipulation --
transposition and inversion -- allow for a tremendous amount of flexibility in
analysis. This flexibility comes with the drawback of making comparison
difficult, because there is no guarantee that a pc set is in the same order.
For this reason, we use normal form to ensure that our comparisons between pc
sets are built in a consistent manner. This is also why you should always
normalize a pc set after inverting it.

\hypertarget{how-many-are-there}{%
\section{How many are there?}\label{how-many-are-there}}

If you were to group all of the unique transpositions and inversions of a pc
set, how many permutations would there be? To explore these ideas, first write
out all unique inversions and transpositions of the following prime form pc
set. This set represents a typical pc set in that every transposition and
inversion is unique. - (014)

Because there are twelve possible starting pitches and for both the starting
set and its inversion, there are typically twenty-four possible pc sets within
a set class. And because we use normal form to represent each pc set within a
set class, this means there is \emph{only} one arrangement of the pc set for
each starting pitch. (If every unique order of pitch classes was considered as
well, there would be vastly more options depending on the cardinality of
(i.e.~the number of pitch classes within) a pc set.

\hypertarget{set-class}{%
\section{Set class}\label{set-class}}

Theoretically, we can determine whether any two pc sets are related by
transposition, inversion, or both. To try this, study the following four
trichords. How are they related? What method(s) will you use to find the
relationships? As you work through this, keep track of the manipulations you
make to find compare them. Hint: It will be helpful to make sure that you are
always working with the normal form. - (2,9,6) - (8,4,1) - (e,2,7) - (6,2,8)

For fairly simple trichords such as these, there are a variety of methods you
could use to compare them. Some people will write them using traditional
notation on a staff, yet others will attempt to visualize them on clock or
number line. These visual methods may work to a degree for a simple trichord
but fail on two accounts - It is difficult to scale to larger, denser pc sets.
- It is difficult to see the relationship for anything other than
transposition.

For these reasons, set theory has a system to reduce and compare any pc set
into a group of all related pc sets. Any two pc sets that are related by
transposition and/or inversion are considered to be part of the same \emph{set
class}. All of the trichords listed above belong to the same set class, and we
can show this using simple manipulations.

If we put each of them into normal form, we get: - {[}2,6,9{]} - {[}1,4,8{]} -
{[}7,e,2{]} - {[}2,6,8{]}

Just by doing this, it easy to use addition and subtraction to show that the
first and third trichords are directly related by transposition: -
T5{[}2,6,9{]} = {[}7,e,2{]})

And the second and fourth are related in the same manner - T1{[}1,4,8{]} =
{[}2,6,8{]}

Because an inverted pc set often has no common tones with its original pc set,
it is more difficult to see inverted relationships. For this, it would be
easier to create a ``standard'' around which we can examine all pc sets in
normal form within a set class. For this, let's try reducing both sets above
to begin with 0. If we do this the first pair of pc sets becomes {[}0,4,7{]}
and the second pair becomes {[}0,3,7{]}. You can see that they are similar in
that they both use pitch classes 0 and 7, but are they related by inversion?
Let's try inverting one of them, normalizing it, and then reducing it to a
normal form that begins on 0.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  {[}2,6,9{]} reduces to {[}0,4,7{]} (by transposing by -2)
\item
  {[}0,4,7{]} inverts to {[}0,8,5{]}
\item
  {[}0,8,5{]} normalizes to {[}5,8,0{]}
\item
  {[}5,8,0{]} reduces to {[}0,3,7{]} (by transposing by -5)
\end{itemize}

Therefore, we can see that all four of our original trichords are related by
transposition and inversion. Or we could also say that \emph{they all belong
to the same \textbf{set class}.}

\hypertarget{prime-form}{%
\section{Prime form}\label{prime-form}}

The process that we just demonstrated is the actual method for finding a pc
set's \emph{prime form}. Prime form is the ``most reduced'' version of any pc
set. It will always start with 0, and it is used to denote an entire \emph{set
class}--all possible transpositions and inversions of a given pc set.

In the above trichords, we had two possible prime forms {[}0,3,7{]} and
{[}0,4,7{]}. These two trichords represent the reduced trichord of both
inversions of this pc set. To determine which is prime form, we apply the same
tie-breakers that we used when determining normal form: start by comparing the
outermost intervals and then work your way inward. Both of these trichords
have an outer interval of 7, but {[}0,3,7{]} has a smaller second interval
(i.e.~0 to 3 is smaller than 0 to 4). Therefore, the prime form of
\textbf{all} of the above trichords is:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{36}
\tightlist
\item
\end{enumerate}

Notice the notation of prime form. For this we use parentheses only with no
commas. (All of the notation that we use for pc sets--unordered, normal, and
prime forms--was standardized by Joseph Straus in his \emph{Introduction to
Post-tonal Theory}.)

\hypertarget{finding-prime-form-for-any-pc-set}{%
\section{Finding prime form for any pc
set}\label{finding-prime-form-for-any-pc-set}}

Now that you understand the goal of prime form -- finding one pc set to
represent all transpositions and inversions -- let's try another one to see if
we can develop a step-by-step process for finding prime form of any pc set.
Try finding the prime form of the following tetrachord. Remember that you need
to check the inversions as well.

(4,t,8,3)

Hopefully you came to the answer of (0157)

To find prime form, you: 1. Put the pc set into normal form. 2. Transpose that
set to begin with 0. - Remember this pc set, because it will be one of two
possible options at the end of the process 3. Invert your pc set. - You may
use either the normal form of the original or the reduced version that begins
with 0. They will get you to the same answer after Step 5. 4. Put the new pc
set into normal form. 5. Transpose this new pc set to begin with 0. 6. Compare
the two pc sets that begin with 0 using the tie-breaker system that we
outlined for identifying normal form. - These are the final forms taken from
steps 2 and 5. - You will always end with a pc set that begins with 0. 7.
Notate your prime form using parentheses and no commas.

\hypertarget{symmetrical-set-classes}{%
\section{Symmetrical set classes}\label{symmetrical-set-classes}}

What could reduce the number of pc sets within a set class? Write out all
unique inversions and transpositions for the two following pc sets for
examples that deviate from the standard possibility of twenty-four unique
permutations. What causes these to have so many less pc sets in the set class?
- (048) - (0158)

The number of pc sets in a set class can be reduced if the pc set is
symmetrical: augmented triads, diminished seventh chords, the whole tone
scale, and the octatonic scales are all symmetrical set classes with less than
twenty-four unique pc sets, but there are many others that have symmetry
reducing the number of pc sets in the set class.

To this point, we have discussed formal labeling systems for a single pitch,
as well as how we can combine these pitches to create scales. Our next step up
the ladder of complexity will be develop a method to measure the distance
between any two pitches, and we do this in Western music notation by looking
at the distance between two pitches changes in function when in a scale.

\hypertarget{intervals}{%
\section{Intervals}\label{intervals}}

Any two-note combination is called a \emph{dyad}, and the distance between the
two pitches of a dyad is an \emph{interval}. Intervals are the fundamental
building blocks of melody and harmony. At their simplest, intervals need only
measure the distance between two pitches, but there are many variables in
music for which we must account.

of the interval between two pitches as represented by an Arabic numeral - the
\emph{quality} of the interval as represented by the labels \emph{perfect,

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-58}}

Our goal when measuring intervals is intrinsically tied to the tonal system
that we use, diatonic harmony. The simplest way to measure the distance
between two intervals would be to measure the distance by the shortest
possible interval--in this case, a half-step (minor second). While easily
understandable, this method does not relate to our concept of tonality.
Instead, counting half-steps creates \emph{interval-classes} in which
intervals are considered equal regardless of the pitches. For example, the
interval of \texttt{G} to \texttt{D-flat} has six half-steps which is
identical to the interval from \texttt{G} to \texttt{C-sharp}. Both even use
the same pitch-classes, however, if you put those into the context of the
scales from the previous unit, you will hopefully associate these two
intervals with different key centers. (\texttt{G} to \texttt{D-flat} is
strongly associated with the key of A-flat major/minor, whereas
\texttt{C-sharp} to \texttt{G} likely implies D major/minor.) The context of
these two intervals is critical in determining their function in tonal
harmony, so we use a system that differentiates between the two.

In a diatonic labeling system, every interval has a \emph{size} and a
\emph{quality}. For example, in a minor second, labeled \texttt{m2}, the
\textbf{m} indicates the \emph{quality} of the interval and the \textbf{2}
indicates the \emph{size} of the interval. Let's look at how we find
\emph{size} first.

\hypertarget{interval-size}{%
\subsection{Interval size}\label{interval-size}}

Interval \emph{size} can be determined by considering either: - lines and
spaces - letter names

Both these methods will correctly identify interval size, although counting
letter names yields results without requiring the presence (or visualization)
of a staff. Do not forget that you must include both letters when counting.
(e.g.~The ascending interval from A to C is a third, because you must count A
(1), B (2), and C (3).)

This means that any interval that has the same two letters, regardless of
accidentals or key signatures, will always have the same \emph{size}. Using
our previous example, the \emph{size} of the interval between \texttt{G} and
\texttt{D-flat} is a fifth: G (1), A (2), B (3), C (4), and D (5). We can
change the bottom note to any other \texttt{G} (\texttt{G-sharp,\ G-flat},
etc.) and the top note to any other \texttt{D} (\texttt{D-sharp,\ D-natural},
etc.), but the \emph{size} of that interval will \textbf{always} be a fifth.
Yet if we exchange the \texttt{D-flat} for its enharmonic equivalent,
\texttt{C-sharp}, we alter the letters and turn the \emph{size} of the
interval into a fourth.

\hypertarget{interval-quality}{%
\subsection{Interval quality}\label{interval-quality}}

In the Western music notation system, interval \emph{quality} is difficult to
examine without beginning to think about our concept of tonality and keys,
because it is designed to describe tonal intervals. It is easiest to
understand \emph{qualities} of intervals by comparing them to the major scale,
so we will look at that below. If you do not yet feel comfortable with scales,
however, you may look at the
\href{02-int-scales-keys/a2-intervals.html}{Further Reading} of this topic to
find a useful method from the writers of \emph{Open Music Theory}.

The most common and straightforward method for learning interval
\emph{quality} compares the interval to a major scale:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Find the size of the interval by counting through the letter between the two
  pitches.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Remember that you must include the starting and ending pitches in your
  counting.
\item
  Remember that size is independent of quality, so none of the following steps
  will affect the interval size.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  To being finding the quality of the interval, consider the bottom pitch of
  the interval as the tonic of a major scale.
\item
  If the top pitch of the interval is a note that naturally exists in the
  major scale built off the lower pitch, it is either a major or perfect
  interval, depending on the \emph{size} of the interval.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Unisons, fourths, fifths, and octaves occur naturally in the major scale as
  \emph{perfect} intervals.
\item
  Seconds, thirds, sixths, and sevenths occur naturally in the major scale as
  \emph{major} intervals.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Any alteration from the basic major and perfect intervals can then be
  labeled by looking at the direction of alteration and the number of
  half-steps that the interval was altered.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the original interval is \emph{perfect}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Raising the interval by a half-step creates an \emph{augmented} interval.
  \item
    Lowering the interval by a half-step creates a \emph{diminished} interval.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  If the original interval is \emph{major}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Raising the interval by a half-step creates an \emph{augmented} interval.
  \item
    Lowering the interval by a half-step creates a \emph{minor} interval.
  \item
    Lowering the interval by a 2 half-steps creates a \emph{diminished}
    interval.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{quality-hierarchies}{%
\subsubsection{Quality hierarchies}\label{quality-hierarchies}}

From this, our interval can be grouped into two distinct hierarchies: - The
``Perfect'' intervals - Interval \emph{sizes} of 1, 4, 5, and 8 can only have
the \emph{qualities} of perfect (P), augmented (A), or diminished (d). - The
``Major/minor'' intervals - Interval \emph{sizes} of 2, 3, 6, and 7 can only
have the \emph{qualities} of major (M), minor (m), augmented (A), or
diminished (d).

Note that even though \emph{perfect} intervals use a different hierarchy than
\emph{major/minor} intervals, both hierarchies share the terms
\emph{diminished} and \emph{augmented}.

\hypertarget{interval-quality-practice}{%
\subsubsection{Interval quality practice}\label{interval-quality-practice}}

Let's practice some examples using this method: - \texttt{C} to \texttt{E}: -
Counting the letter names confirms that the \emph{size} is a third - C (1), D
(2), E (3) - If we consider the lower pitch, \texttt{C}, as the tonic of a
major scale, we can use the C-major scale to find that the naturally occurring
\texttt{E} in the key of C major is \texttt{E-natural}. - Because this is an
interval size of a third, we must use the \emph{major} hierarchy, so
therefore, \texttt{E-natural} would be a **major third *(M3)\textbf{ above C.
- \texttt{D} to \texttt{G-sharp} - Counting the letter names confirms that the
\emph{size} is a fourth - D (1), E (2), F (3), G (4) - By setting the lower
pitch, \texttt{D}, as a tonic, we can use the D-major scale to find that the
naturally occurring \texttt{G} in the key of D major is \texttt{G-natural}.
Therefore, \texttt{G-natural} is a perfect 4th above D, because all naturally
occurring intervals in a major scale are either perfect or major depending on
their size. - Because \texttt{G-sharp} is one half-step above the
\emph{perfect} interval, we go one step up the ``perfect'' hierarchy to find
that this interval is an }augmented fourth (A4)\textbf{. - \texttt{F} to
\texttt{E-double-flat} - Counting the letter names confirms that the
\emph{size} is a seventh (F, G, A, B C, D, E = 7) - By using the lower pitch,
\texttt{F}, as \texttt{do}, we can use the F-major scale to find that the
naturally occurring \texttt{E} in the key of F major is \texttt{E-natural}. -
Because this is a seventh, we must use the \emph{major} hierarchy, so
therefore, \texttt{E-natural} would be a M7 above F. - Because
\texttt{E-double-flat} is two half-steps below the \emph{major} interval, we
go two steps down the major hierarchy to find that this interval is an
}diminished seventh (d7)**.

\hypertarget{melodic-vs.-harmonic}{%
\subsection{Melodic vs.~Harmonic}\label{melodic-vs.-harmonic}}

Melodic and harmonic intervals are one of the simplest concepts to understand,
although the describing them can be problematic. At first, students often
describe harmonic intervals as occurring ``at the same time'' while melodic
intervals occur ``at different times.'' While this is a simple explanation, we
must be careful in how we apply the terms \emph{interval} and \emph{pitches}.
The interval is the space between the two pitches, therefore, the interval
cannot occur ``at the same time'' or ``at different times.'' The pitches can
occur simultaneously or consecutively, but the interval always exists as a
fixed measurement. This is how we can label harmonic and melodic intervals
using the same system.

I recommend that we think of intervals as existing on either a horizontal or
vertical axis, because we can visualize axes (as in the plural of axis) easily
on musical staff notation. If two pitches occur ``at the same time,'' they
will be aligned vertically on a staff. If two pitches occur consecutively,
they will represent unique points on a horizontal line that runs parallel to
the lines of the staff. This may seem overly technical, but it is an important
distinction.

A final note: melodic intervals can have two modifiers attached to them,
\emph{ascending} or \emph{descending}. Ascending intervals start with the
lower of the two pitches, whereas descending intervals start on the the higher
pitch. Harmonic intervals cannot be ascending or descending.

\hypertarget{simple-vs.-compound}{%
\subsection{Simple vs.~Compound}\label{simple-vs.-compound}}

Simple intervals include any interval that is equal to or smaller than an
octave. Compound intervals are any interval larger than an octave.

To label compound intervals, we count letter names as we do for simple
intervals. We can find a compound interval by adding 7 to any simple interval.
For example, a 2nd becomes a 9th. A 4th becomes an 11th. An 8ve (octave)
becomes a 15th.

Conversely, if we see a compound interval, we can find its simple equivalent
by subtracting 7. A 12th is a 5th plus an octave. A 10th is a 3rd plus an
octave.

You may ask why we don't add eight considering that we are adding an octave.
The answer lies in how we find the \emph{size} of intervals. When we find
interval \emph{size}, we count the letter names \emph{and include the starting
pitch}. When we add an octave, we have already used the top note so we are
missing one letter. For example, a fifth from A to E includes the letters
\texttt{A\ B\ C\ D\ E}. If we add an octave, the first \texttt{E} was already
included in the first interval of the 5th, so we are only adding seven letters
\texttt{F\ G\ A\ B\ C\ D\ E}.

\hypertarget{chromatic-vs.-diatonic}{%
\subsection{Chromatic vs.~Diatonic}\label{chromatic-vs.-diatonic}}

The difference between chromatic and diatonic is probably the most
straightforward of interval classifications in usage, but it has a level of
nuance that students often miss and causes confusion later. Simply put,
\emph{diatonic} intervals contain only pitches that belong to the
\textbf{current} tonality, whereas \emph{chromatic} intervals contain at least
one pitch that does not belong to the current tonality.

Of course, this relies on you knowing what the current tonality is. In many
situations, this means that you can find chromatic pitches, and therefore
chromatic interals, wherever you find a note with an accidental. So if the key
signature matches the current tonality--for example, the key signature has two
sharps and the tonality is D major--any pitch that does not have an accidental
is a \emph{chromatic} pitch and all intervals formed with that pitch would be
chromatic intervals.

\hypertarget{inversions-1}{%
\subsection{Inversions}\label{inversions-1}}

An easy way to think of inverted intervals is to consider an inversion to be
an interval in which one pitch is fixed and the other is transposed by one
octave toward the fixed pitch.

\hypertarget{inverting-size}{%
\subsubsection{Inverting size}\label{inverting-size}}

To determine the \emph{size} of an inverted interval, it is easiest to simply
memorize the interval pairs, so: - 4 inverts to 5 and vice versa - 3 inverts
to 6 and vice versa - 2 inverts to 7 and vice versa - 1 inverts to 8 and vice
versa

Each of these pairs adds up to nine, so if you ever forget or doubt your
memorization, you can find an inversion by simply subtracting the interval
size from 9. For example, if there is a written 3rd, subtract 3 from 9 to find
that the inversion of a 3rd is a 6th. Note that for compound intervals, you
must use subtract from 16 or use negative numbers and absolute values. Because
of this, it is easier to reduce compound intervals to a simple interval before
inverting.

\hypertarget{inverting-quality}{%
\subsubsection{Inverting quality}\label{inverting-quality}}

To find the qualities of inverted intervals, you simply need to memorize three
pairs: - diminished becomes augmented and vice versa - major becomes minor and
vice versa - perfect becomes perfect and vice versa

We will explore the mathematical underpinnings of why inversions form these
pairs in Unit 23.

In looking at triads and seventh chords, we have only learned how to label and
classify these musical objects without specifying a particular root. A major
triad or a dominant seventh chord can be built off any of the twelve
pitch-classes, and each of the pitch-classes have multiple options depending
on which enharmonic equivalent you choose as the root.

There is one commonly-used method that allows us to label specific triads and
seventh chords as well as their inversions: \emph{leadsheet notation}. This is
also sometimes referred to as \emph{slash-chord notation}, \emph{jazz chord
symbols}, or \emph{pop chord symbols}. This system for labeling chords is most
commonly seen in jazz and pop music, but it is useful to all musicians because
it is an efficient system for communicating chords \emph{of any complexity}.

Even after we introduce Roman numeral analysis and harmonic function in Unit
6, we will continue to use leadsheet notation to provide a harmonic overview
of complex analyses before we try to assign harmonic function and
relationships. For example, if we have a C major triad and an F major triad
and no other context, we cannot be sure of their key and function, so Roman
numeral notation is not very useful. For those with a knowledge of diatonic
function, it would seem most likely that these two chords belong to F major,
but they could also exist diatonically in the keys of C major, D minor, A
minor, as well as various modes. When analyzing harmonically ambiguous
functions, it is critical to have a shorthand for labeling chords, so that we
can look at the overview rather than re-analyzing each chord every time we
come to a section of music.

\subsection{Basic leadsheet notation}\label{basic-leadsheet-notation}}

The general naming system that we have used thus far allows us to talk about
general categories of triads and seventh chords, but does not allow us to
specify the exact root of a chord. Leadsheet notation is a shorthand method
written above the staff that specifies a chord's root and quality. Leadsheet
notation never had a centralized authority, so over many decades, it evolved
various ways to denote the same chord qualities.

Leadsheet notation consists of a note name followed by a chord shorthand. The
note name denotes the root of the chord, and is most commonly an upper-case
letter regardless of the chord's quality. Some systems use a lower-case letter
for minor chords, but this is less common and is problematic for letters that
have similar upper-case and lower-case versions such as \texttt{c}. (And of
course can be exacerbated if the writer's penmanship is poor.) For our course,
I will always use an upper-case root in my leadsheet notation.

The chord quality shorthand can vary greatly, so we have listed the more
common possibilities below for chords with a root of C. I have listed them in
my order of preference -- again taking student penmanship into account.
Clarity should be valued above brevity.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Major Triad: C (no shorthand necessary, just a capital root name)
\item
  Minor Triad: Cmin, Cm, C-
\item
  Augmented Triad: Caug, C+
\item
  Diminished Triad: Cdim, Co
\item
  Major major (major seventh chord): Cmaj7, CM7, CΔ
\item
  Major minor (dominant seventh chord): C7
\item
  Minor minor (minor seventh chord): Cmin7, Cm7, C-7
\item
  Diminished minor (half-diminished seventh chord): Cø7, Cø, Cmin7(b5)
\item
  Diminished diminished (fully-diminished seventh chord): Cdim7, Co7
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{inversions-in-leadsheet-notation}{%
\subsection{Inversions in leadsheet

We are also able to show chord inversions in leadsheet notation by using
\emph{slash-chords}. To use slashchords, you use standard standard leadsheet
notation followed by a slash (/) and then the \emph{bass} note. This allows
you to show any inversion. For example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  C7/E is a C dominant seventh chord in first-inversion.
\item
  C7/G is a C dominant seventh chord in second-inversion.
\item
  C7/B♭ is a C dominant seventh chord in third-inversion.

\hypertarget{extended-harmonies-in-leadsheet-notation}{%
\subsection{Extended harmonies in leadsheet
notation}\label{extended-harmonies-in-leadsheet-notation}}

As tertian harmony evolved from its earliest roots, some composers began
adding pitches to chords beyond the chordal seventh. We will use the term
\emph{extended harmony} to refer to these chords, but in common usage, this
term can also encompass chords that do not adhere to standard triad and
seventh chord structures.

For chords that extend beyond the seventh chord, we typically use the terms
\emph{ninth} for the second scale degree, \emph{eleventh} for the fourth scale
degree, and \emph{thirteenth} for the sixth scale degree, because these
extensions are a continuation of stacked thirds continuing above the seventh
chord. A Cmin11 implies that it has the normal minor seventh chord with both
the diatonic ninth and eleventh added above it.

As with standard leadsheet notation for seventh chords, if you have a number
alone, it always implies a dominant seventh chord with extensions. A C13 is a
dominant seventh chord built on the root C with extensions up to the
thirteenth. The only notable exception to this rule is the 6/9 chord; the
shorthand in this case implies a major seventh even though there is no
signifier other than the two numbers.

\hypertarget{sus-chords}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Sus} chords}{Sus chords}}\label{sus-chords}}

As we move into studying the ways that composers embellish their music later
in the course, we will study \emph{suspensions}--a note that \emph{does not
belong to a chord}, but instead adds extra tension and color before resolving
downward by step. In modern music however, there exists a standalone chord
called a sus chord, which resembles the non-chord tone suspension of previous
eras, but because the sus chord can be used without resolution, it has its own
leadsheet notation.

Csus

Any time that you see the abbreviation \emph{sus} added to a chord in
leadsheet notation, this implies that there is no chordal third. Instead, you
will use the diatonic pitch that is a fourth above the \emph{root}. So for a
Csus, you will replace the E that would normally be present in a C major triad
with an F. This would not change even if the bass note was altered; it will
always replace the chordal third with the step above it. Any further
alterations are best handled using\ldots{}

\hypertarget{sub-and-add}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Sub} and
\emph{Add}}{Sub and Add}}\label{sub-and-add}}

The two commands \emph{sub} and \emph{add} are useful when writing leadsheet
notation of non-standard chords. Admittedly, these will not be used much in
diatonic harmony, but understanding their usage now will help when we move
into chromatic harmonies.

Because triads and seventh chords are built in thirds, every third above the
root has a predetermined quality based on the chord quality and root. If you
would like to alter one of those chordal members, you can use the \emph{sub}
followed by an altered chordal member to imply that you are \emph{replacing}
that chordal member. For example, the alternate method for half-diminished
seventh chords comes from this. Because a diminished triad is a minor triad
with a lowered fifth chordal member, you could use the leadsheet notation for
a minor seventh chord and substitute a lowered 5th. This would look like:

Cmin7(sub b5)

Admittedly, this method for notating half-diminished seventh chords is common
enough that it is not required to use ``sub'' in this particular example, but
this is still an excellent example of the proper way to use the sub command.

\emph{Add}, on the other hand, does not alter any of the chordal members, but
instead adds an extra chord tone. If you would like to add a raised ninth to a
dominant 7th chord without altering the third, you could use:

C7(add\#9)

If you master these two commands in your leadsheet notation, it is possible to
denote any combination of altered pitches and substitutions for even the most
complicated music. Of course, this assumes that the music still has at least
its basic roots in tertian harmony, but even through the current day, almost
all Western music does.

Having just explored how changing the tempo of a piece written in 3/x can
change the classfication between compound and simple, it should be no surprise
that aural interpretation of meter is a subjective process. Many factors play
a role in determining how a listener perceives a meter including tempo,
accented beats, melodic patterns, and previously established ``grooves.''

The examples on the following page will help you explore a few of the many
ways in which a composer or performer can alter the perception of meter.

\hypertarget{syncopation}{%
\section{Syncopation}\label{syncopation}}

\emph{Syncopation} occurs when a note emphasizes the ``weak'' beats of a
measure, but as discussed in Topic 4b, meter is based on our perception and is
therefore a subjective phenomenon. Listen to the first three bars of the
following example without looking at the music. Try tapping your perceived
pulse until the end of the excerpt, and then see if your mental construction
of the rhythm matches the piece.

\hypertarget{conclusions-61}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-61}}

The very idea of strong and weak beats relies on a recognizable, steady pulse.
Even though the first line above is clearly written in a syncopated pattern
that begins on the \& of 1, most listeners hear the first pitch as the
downbeat because it is the first pitch they hear. However, when the top line
is added in the fourth measure, it becomes possible to hear the bottom line as
syncopated because an earlier reference has been established. In general, a
listener will hear the first sound of a piece of music as a downbeat unless
other contextual clues--such as melodic shape, note shape, or accents--lead
them to think otherwise.

Syncopation occurs when emphasis is put on the ``weak'' beats of the meter,
but the above example shows the subjectivity of this. If a listener listens to
the example without looking at the notation, it would be impossible to know
that the example starts on an offbeat. It is therefore worth noting that
strong and weak beats are determined by \emph{context}, not by meter. Once the
top line is added to the excerpt, the listener may still hear the bottom line
as taking place on the beat if they listened to it without looking at the
notation, while some may ``switch'' the beat in their mind to make the bottom
line a strongly syncopated rhythm. Syncopation can occur within a single line
if the beat is established first and then weak beat rhythms are introduced,
but this is still an example of establishing the strong beats for the listener
before syncopation can begin.

\subsection{Written time signatures versus aural
perception}\label{written-time-signatures-versus-aural-perception}}

This excerpt demonstrated how a variation--in this example, melodic shape--can
affect listener perception. Aurally, both parts sounded identical regardless
of the meter, but when listening and not looking at the excerpt, most
listeners feel that the piece is in a compound duple meter. This demonstrates
that even though a pattern can be written in various meters, there are other
factors that can strongly pull toward a particular meter. In this case, the
motif is melodically grouped into two groups of three, so it pulls most of the
listeners toward a 6/8 feel. One may hear this in 3/4, but this would require
other factors such as accents, silence, and tempo to affect how the listener
perceives the passage.

It should be noted that many composers rely on using meters to evoke
particular rhythmic biases in the performer, so it is disingenuous to say that
meter is \emph{entirely} subjective. Stravinsky was well-known to write the
same passage in various meters (e.g.~\emph{Rite of Spring}, \emph{L'histoire
du Soldat}), so a good performer is aware of what the meter is trying to tell
them.

Listen to the first 20 seconds of the following clip of \emph{Sintra} from
Snarky Puppy's incredible collaboration with the Metropole Orkest. How would
you classify the meter? What can you tell about the performers' sense of the
meter from their body language, particularly the conductor? Does it match
yours?

The next clip starts slightly before the previous clip. How would you classify
this meter? Does it affect how you perceive the material from the previous
clip? What can you tell about the performers' sense of the meter from their
body language, particularly the conductor? Does it match yours?

The final clip starts in the introduction of this piece. This is clearly in a
different meter than the previous two clips but it segues smoothly into the
new section. How does this affect your perception of the material from the
previous two clips? What can you tell about the performers' sense of the meter
from their body language, particularly the conductor? Does it match yours?

\hypertarget{conclusions-62}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-62}}

By starting at this particular point in the piece, most listeners will hear
this section in a slow, simple triple meter. But an observant student may have
noticed the conductor in the background (around the 2:29 mark) conducting in a
double-time three, which means that the conductor is placing an
\emph{off-beat} where the listener is likely hearing beat 2 of their slow
simple triple meter. If we move our starting point backward by only ten
seconds, we hear the original groove of this section of the tune, which is the
origin of the double-time simple triple meter that we saw the conductor using.

By starting at this new point, many listeners will switch to a faster
(double-time) simple triple meter. The listener may or may not carry this feel
through the half-time section from the first clip, but given the conductor's
beat pattern, we can be fairly certain that the orchestra is counting this
section as if there is no change in meter.

Perhaps even more interesting is the effect on the listener when we move our
starting point back into the the intro of the piece.

The introduction is clearly in a slow compound quadruple meter. The melody
happens mostly at the beat level, and the cellos have a constant arpeggio at
the subdivision level. At the 1:20 mark, there is a slightly disconcerting
two-beat transition, and then a new section starts that most listeners will
hear as a continuation of the slow compound quadruple meter of the intro. This
is reinforced by an ostinato in a contra-bass clarinet as well as the body
language of the performers. When the trumpet and saxophone enter with a new
melody at 1:32, we realize that this slow compound quadruple meter is the
exact same feel and melody that we heard as a fast simple triple melody in the
second clip.

The conclusion of this exercise should be that the listener's perception of
meter is not tied to what is on the page, only to a complex array of aural
input. Therefore, we can discuss meter in an objective manner by looking at
what is written, but a listener is not required to hear the meter similarly to
an analysis or even in the way in which the composer intended.

First-inversion and third-inversion chords are used to make smoother, more
melodic bass lines, but in doing so, we put tendency tones--and all of the
accompanying expectations--into the bass. Even though this seems more
restrictive, first- and third- inversion chords actually allow more freedom in
part-writing because: - they remove the potential objectionable parallels that
come from having the root in the bass. - the upper voices have one less
tendency tone to distribute and resolve correctly.

\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-63}}

With first and third inversion chords, we place either the chordal third or
chordal seventh in the bass. Both of these chord tones are tendency tones, and
tendency tones in outer voices follow fairly strict rules in this style.

For first-inversion triads and seventh chords in circle-of-fifths
progressions, the bass note should resolve up by step to the root of the
following chord, meaning that the chord following a first-inversion chord will
likely be in root position. For third-inversion seventh chords (there are no
third-inversion triads), the chordal seventh in the bass should resolve down
by step, and if it is a circle-of-fifths progression, the bass will resolve to
the chordal third of the next chord making it a first-inversion chord.

Of course, these guidelines assume that we are harmonizing circle-of-fifths
progressions. If you do not have roots that are separated by P4/P5, we can
create guidelines using functional substitutions.

\hypertarget{function-over-form-part-2}{%
\section{Function over form (Part 2)}\label{function-over-form-part-2}}

When harmonizing the the root-position deceptive progression from the previous
topic, we discussed that you should treat the vi chord in a deceptive
progression as a \emph{functional substitution} for tonic. Because the vi
chord acts as a tonic function when part of a deceptive progression, we double
the scale degree that works best for the standard tonic chord, \texttt{do} of
the I chord, rather than the general part-writing doubling rule for root
position chords in which you would prefer to double the root. This means that
in the deceptive progression, it is correct to break standard doubling
convention and double the chordal third of the vi chord. Now that we are
looking at first inversion voice-leading, we have another \emph{functional
substitution} to discuss. - viio is a dominant function, so therefore
functions as V7 chord without its root

Because of this, the viio chord must follow different \emph{doubling} rules in
order to avoid poor voice-leading. With this in mind, try to harmonize the
following progressions; first a simple I-V6/5-I progression, and then with an
added root-position viio chord. You will discover that: - the two chords have
all but one pitch in common. - resolving a root-position viio is extremely
difficult and will require one voice to make consecutive jumps of a P5 to
avoid issues due to tendency tone resolutions.**

Because the root position viio triad is so difficult, it is rarely used. It is
not possible to resolve a root-position viio triad to a I chord without
breaking at least one part-writing norm. A root-position viio must either pass
through another chord or be inverted to resolve directly to I.

As a general rule of thumb, any diminished triad (including the iio in minor)
will typically need to have the chordal third doubled, because the tension of
the diminished fifth and its tendency tones.

\hypertarget{function-over-form-part-3}{%
\section{Function over form (Part 3)}\label{function-over-form-part-3}}

The pre-dominant function presents an issue that the functional substitutions
in tonic and dominant functions do not. To this point, we have considered the
circle-of-fifths as the voice-leading foundation for diatonic harmony. In this
case, the ii chord would be the ``primary'' pre-dominant function, and in many
ways, this is true. The IV chord, however, holds a special place in harmony
because of its role as the \emph{subdominant}--the opposite pole of the
dominant--as well as the high frequency throughout history of the I-IV-V-I
progression.

Generally speaking, root position ii chords and root position IV chords are
equally strong and follow standard doubling conventions. When the ii chord is
in first inversion, however, it can be voiced as if it is the functional
substitution of a root-position IV chord meaning that a ii6 chord often takes
its doubling from a root-position IV chord. (In the same way that a viio chord
takes its doubling from a V7 chord.) Try this on the following progressions.
(Make sure to consider the common direction and motion for upper voices tend
to do when a root position IV chord moves to a V chord.)

While it is certainly possible to voice the pre-dominant function chords in
these progressions following standard doubling conventions, it can create less
than appealing voicings for the ii chord, particularly in its triad form. When
in first inversion, you may choose to double the third of the ii, in which
case, it is acting as a functional substitution of a root-position IV chord.

Thus far, we have only described a chord's function using the \emph{primary}
functions of tonic, dominant, and pre-dominant. We now add a new category of
functions called \emph{tertiary} functions--which we will discuss in detail in
the next topic, Unit 11d--and our first type of tertiary function is the
\emph{passing chord}. (If you are wondering why we are skipping over secondary
functions, we will cover those in Unit 14.) A \emph{passing chord} is a chord
that is inserted between two other chords to create stepwise motion within a
voice--usually in the bass line. You can consider \emph{passing} a function
that removes a chord's standard function (i.e.~tonic, dominant, and
predominant), and instead extends the function of the chords on either side.

Let's see how this works by attempting an example that seemingly breaks all of
our harmonic progressions norms. When you first look at the progression below,
you should immediately notice that a V chord resolves to a IV chord--which
does not follow our harmonic flowchart of primary functions. While this is
generally true, there is something happening here that requires you to look at
the bigger picture. Try to harmonize the following progression using your best
voice-leading, and as you do so, pay particular attention to the motion within
each voice. You will notice that there is no tenor voice in the first chord,
so you may try multiple options to see if you can find a solution for a tenor
voice that fulfills all guidelines thus far.

\hypertarget{conclusions-65}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-65}}

In the example above, the melodic, stepwise motion of the bass line traps us
into making some difficult harmonic choices. We want to end on a PAC, which
means that as we extend the progression backward, we don't have any choices
that would follow our standard harmonic flowchart of primary functions.
(Please refer to Unit 7a if you need a refresher on primary functions in
diatonic harmony.) We can use a pre-dominant function on beat 3 to lead to our
dominant function chord on beat 4, but there are no primary function harmonies
that lead to a pre-dominant that also incorporate the leading tone of the bass
line. (Of note, the IM7 is not used in this style of composition; you are
welcome to try it and you will notice that it doesn't sound to out of place,
but we would analyze this as two beats of a I chord with a passing tone
(non-chord tone) on the second beat of the bass line.)

The solution is to use another dominant chord on beat 2. Even though we would
not normally have a dominant harmony resolve to a IV chord, in this case, the
IV chord is not functioning as a IV chord with its typical primary function as
a pre-dominant chord. Instead, it has taken on a \emph{tertiary function} as a
\emph{passing chord}. Look at the voice-leading within each voice of this
completed example:

\{\% capture ex6 \%\}X:6 T:Passing chord extending dominant function M:4/4
L:1/4 Q:1/4=60 K:C V:1 {[}cE{]}{[}dD{]}{[}cF{]}{[}dF{]}\textbar{}

w:C:I V6 IV6 V7 I\{\% endcapture \%\} \{\% include abc-example.html
number=``6'' abc=ex6 \%\}

If you were to ignore the fact that beat 3 forms a standard triad, you can
assign each voice on beat 3 to a standard non-chord tone label, as if it were
not part of a harmony. - The soprano voice is a neighbor tone between the two
Cs. - The alto voice is an anticipation of the F on beat 4. - The tenor voice
is a passing tone between beats 2 and 4. - And most importantly, the bass
voice is a passing tone between beats 2 and 4. So even though a V chord does
not usually resolve to a IV chord, in this particular case, it only
\emph{looks} as if it is resolving to a IV chord. In reality, each voice is
simply moving through a non-chord tone\ldots which happens to form a standard
triad on beat 3. So instead of trying to label the IV chord as having a
standard function, you would say that it's function is extending the dominant
function on either side of it.

So when this happens, we still want to acknowledge that the chord exists, but
we also want to note that it is no longer a primary function. We will discuss
the notation of of tertiary functions more in the next topic, but for now,
label them using their standard Roman numeral and inversion figure, but put
the Roman numeral inside of parentheses with a label of ``pass'' directly
beneath it. Note that passing chords--meaning chords who create passing motion
in one or more voices--act as if they are a group of non-chord tones. You may
even think of them as ``non-chord tone chords'' if that helps. A listener will
hear this progression as an extension of the dominant function, not as an
alternating dominant/pre-dominant/dominant pattern. Any inversion of a chord
can be classified as a passing chord as long as it creates stepwise motion in
one or more voices--usually the bass voice--and it is common for many first-
and third-inversion chords function this way.

You may also notice that we have an unusual doubling on the IV6 chord, but
once we discuss second inversion chords in the next unit, we will be able to
update the guidelines for doubling chord tones to more closely reflect what
exists in music.

There are a lot of counterpoint rules, but you can eliminate possible errors
by priotizing things that those rules don't pertain to: - Stepwise motion!
There's a lot of rules that have to do with usage of skips and leaps, and by
focusing on stepwise motion you avoid these - Your counterpoint will
\emph{always} end with re in one voice and ti in the other. If you put
yourself in a position to get to those notes that bar before the penultimate
bar, the last two measures will write themselves - Focus on using imperfect
consonances/sixths and thirds. These have less rules than perfect consonances
- Be mindful of how you approach skips and leaps if you have to use them

\hypertarget{passing-tone-pt-1}{%
\subsubsection{Passing Tone (PT)}\label{passing-tone-pt-1}}

\includegraphics{images/embellishingTones/passingTone.png}

A passing tone is a melodic embellishment (typically a non-chord tone) that
occurs between two stable tones (typically chord tones), creating stepwise
motion. The typical figure is \emph{chord tone -- passing tone -- chord tone},
filling in a third (see example), but two adjacent passing tones can also be
used to fill in the space between two chord tones a fourth apart. A passing
tone can be either accented (occurring on a strong beat or strong part of the
beat) or unaccented (weak beat or weak part of the beat).

\hypertarget{complete-neighbor-tone-nt}{%
\subsubsection{Complete Neighbor Tone (NT)}\label{complete-neighbor-tone-nt}}

\includegraphics{images/embellishingTones/neighborTone.png}

Like the passing tone, a complete neighbor tone is a melodic embellishment
that occurs between two stable tones (typically chord tones); however, a
complete neighbor tone will occur between two instances of the same stable
tone. Also like the passing tone, movement from the stable tone to the
neighbor tone and back will always be by step. A complete neighbor can be
either accented or unaccented, but unaccented is more common.

\hypertarget{double-neighbor-figure-dn}{%
\subsubsection{Double Neighbor Figure (DN)}\label{double-neighbor-figure-dn}}

\includegraphics{/images/embellishingTones/doubleNeighbor.png}

Like the complete neighbor figure, the double neighbor figure begins and ends
on the \emph{same} stable tone (typically a chord tone). Between those two
instances of the stable tone are two embellishing tones --- one a step above
and the other a step below the stable tone being embellished. Though
individually we may consider each of the two embellishing tones to be
incomplete neighbors (below), working together in the double-neighbor figure
they balance each other out and create a contiguous whole, with the overall
stability of a complete neighbor. A double neighbor figure is typically
unaccented.

\hypertarget{incomplete-neighbor-tone-int-1}{%
\subsubsection{Incomplete Neighbor Tone
(INT)}\label{incomplete-neighbor-tone-int-1}}

\includegraphics{images/embellishingTones/INT.png}

The incomplete neighbor tone is an unaccented embellishing tone that is
approached by leap and proceeds by step to an accented stable tone (typically
a chord tone). Broadly speaking an incomplete neighbor tone is any
embellishing tone a step away from a stable tone that proceeds or follows it
(and is connected on the other side by leap), but other kinds of incomplete
neighbor tones have special names and roles that follow below.

\hypertarget{appoggiatura-app}{%
\subsubsection{Appoggiatura (APP)}\label{appoggiatura-app}}

\includegraphics{images/embellishingTones/appoggiatura.png}

An appoggiatura is a kind of incomplete neighbor tone that is accented,
approached by leap (usually up), and followed by step (usually down, but
always in the opposite direction of the preceding leap) to a more stable tone
(typically a chord tone).

\hypertarget{escape-tone-esc}{%
\subsubsection{Escape Tone (ESC)}\label{escape-tone-esc}}

\includegraphics{images/embellishingTones/escapeTone.png}

An escape tone, or \emph{echappée}, is a kind of incomplete neighbor tone that
is unaccented, preceded by step (usually up) from a chord tone, and followed
by leap (usually down, but always in the opposite direction of the preceding
step).

\hypertarget{anticipation-ant}{%
\subsubsection{Anticipation (ANT)}\label{anticipation-ant}}

\includegraphics{images/embellishingTones/anticipation.png}

An anticipation is essentially an otherwise stable tone that comes too early.
An anticipation is typically a non-chord tone that will occur immediately
before a change of harmony, and it will be followed on that change of harmony
by the same note, now a chord tone of the new harmony. It is typically found
at the ends of phrases and larger formal units.

\hypertarget{syncopation-syn}{%
\subsubsection{Syncopation (SYN)}\label{syncopation-syn}}

\includegraphics{/images/embellishingTones/syncopatedNote.png}

\href{http://openmusictheory.com/syncopation.html}{Syncopation} occurs when a
rhythmic pattern that typically occurs on strong beats or strong parts of the
beat occurs instead on weak beats or weak parts of the beat. Like the
anticipation, the syncopated note is an early arrival --- it tends to belong
to the chord on the following beat. Unlike the anticipation, the syncopation
is tied into a note in that chord; it is not rearticulated. Rather than
anticipating a note in the chord that follows, a syncopation is simply an
early arrival.

\hypertarget{suspension-sus-1}{%
\subsubsection{Suspension (SUS)}\label{suspension-sus-1}}

\includegraphics{images/embellishingTones/suspension.png}

A suspension is formed of three critical parts: the \emph{preparation}
(accented or unaccented), the \emph{suspension} itself (accented), and the
\emph{resolution} (unaccented). The preparation is a chord tone (consonance).
The suspension is \emph{the same note} as the preparation and occurs
simultaneous with a change of harmony. The suspension then proceeds down by
step to the resolution, which occurs over the same harmony as the suspension.
The suspension is in many respects the opposite of the syncopation: if the
anticipation is an early arrival of a tone belonging to the following chord, a
suspension is a lingering of a chord tone belonging to the previous chord that
forces the late arrival of the new chord's chord tone. However, in composition
and improvisation, the suspension must be treated with a great deal more care
than the syncopation. The most common suspensions (and their resolutions) in
upper voices form the following intervallic patterns against the bass: 9--8,
7--6, 4--3. (With the exception of 9--8, the pitch class of the resolution
tone should never sound in another voice simultaneous with the suspended
tone.) Instead of \emph{SUS}, it is more typical to notate the intervallic
pattern in the thoroughbass figures.

\hypertarget{retardation-ret}{%
\subsubsection{Retardation (RET)}\label{retardation-ret}}

\includegraphics{images/embellishingTones/retardation.png}

A retardation is essentially an upward-resolving suspension. It is almost
always reserved for the final chord of a large formal division (or a
movement), and it frequently appears simultaneously with a suspension (as seen
in the example). Instead of \emph{RET}, it is preferable to notate the
intervallic pattern in the thoroughbass figures.

\hypertarget{second-species-counterpoint-1}{%
\subsection{Second species counterpoint}\label{second-species-counterpoint-1}}

\hypertarget{the-counterpoint-line-1}{%
\section{The counterpoint line}\label{the-counterpoint-line-1}}

As in first species, the counterpoint line should be singable, have a good
shape, with a single climax and primarily stepwise motion (with some small
leaps and an occasional large leap for variety). However, because a
first-species counterpoint had so few notes, in order to maintain smoothness
in other aspects of the exercise, the melody frequently employed small leaps.
In second species, the increase in notes and the added freedom involving the
use of dissonance makes it easier to move by step without causing other
musical problems. Thus, a second-species counterpoint is even \emph{more
dominated by stepwise motion} than in first species.

If the counterpoint must leap, take advantage of the metrical arrangement to
diminish the attention drawn to the leap: leap from strong beat to weak beat
(within the bar) rather than from weak beat to strong beat (across the
barline) when possible.

Also, because there are more notes in a second species line, there should
usually be one or two \emph{secondary climaxes}---notes lower than the overall
climax that serve as ``local'' climaxes for portions of the line. This will
help the integrity of the line, by ensuring it has a coherent shape and does
not simply wander around.

\hypertarget{beginning-a-second-species-counterpoint}{%
\subsection{Beginning a second-species
counterpoint}\label{beginning-a-second-species-counterpoint}}

As in first species, begin a second-species counterpoint above the cantus
firmus with \emph{do} or \emph{sol}. Begin a second-species counterpoint below
the cantus firmus with \emph{do}. Unisons are permitted for the first and last
dyads of the exercise.

A second-species line can begin with two half notes in the first bar, or a
half rest followed by a half note. Beginning with a half rest establishes the
rhythmic profile more readily, making it easier for the listener to parse, so
it is often preferable. It is also easier to compose. Regardless of rhythm,
the first pitch in the counterpoint should follow the intervallic rules above.

\hypertarget{ending-a-second-species-counterpoint}{%
\subsection{Ending a second-species
counterpoint}\label{ending-a-second-species-counterpoint}}

The final pitch of the counterpoint should be \emph{do}, as in first species.

The penultimate note of the counterpoint should be \emph{ti} if the cantus is
\emph{re}, and \emph{re} if the cantus is \emph{ti}, as in first species.

The penultimate bar of the counterpoint can either be a \emph{whole note}
(making the last two bars identical to first species), or two half notes.
Which option you use will depend on how you are approaching the final bar.
(This is simply a historical convention, not a musical necessity. But the
added degree of freedom makes it easier to move into the final arrival
smoothly without adding too many complicating factors.)

\hypertarget{strong-beats}{%
\subsection{Strong beats}\label{strong-beats}}

\emph{Because the inclusion of dissonance in a musical texture creates new
musical problems that need to be addressed, second species introduces
dissonance in a very limited way. This is not a musical necessity, and it's
not the only way to address dissonance, but it helps by introducing a small
number of new musical difficulties in each species.}

Strong beats (downbeats) in second species are \emph{always consonant}. As in
first species, prefer imperfect consonances (thirds and sixths) to perfect
consonances (fifths and octaves), and avoid unisons.

Because motion across bar lines (from weak beat to strong beat) involves the
same kind of voice motion as first species (two voices moving simultaneously),
follow the same principles as first species counterpoint. For instance, if a
weak beat is a perfect fifth, the following downbeat must not also be a
perfect fifth.

Likewise progressions from downbeat to downbeat must follow principles of
first-species counterpoint. The following are some examples, but not an
exhaustive list:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Do not begin two consecutive bars with the same perfect interval.\\
\item
  Do not outline a dissonant melodic interval between consecutive downbeats.
  (Exception: if the counterpoint leaps an octave from the strong beat to the
  weak beat, the leap should be followed by step in the opposite direction
  making a seventh with the preceding downbeat. This is okay, since it is the
  result of smooth voice motion.)\\
\item
  Do not begin more than three bars in a row with the same imperfect
  consonance.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Hidden} or \emph{direct fifths/octaves} between successive downbeats are
fine, as the effect is weak, and the intervening note in the counterpoint
diminishes that effect.

\hypertarget{weak-beats}{%
\subsection{Weak beats}\label{weak-beats}}

Since harmonic dissonances can appear on weak beats, a mixture of consonant
and dissonant intervals on weak beats is the best way to promote variety.

Unisons were problematic in first species because they diminished the
independence of the lines. However, when they occur on the weak beats of
second species and are the result of otherwise smooth voice-leading, the
rhythmic difference in line is sufficient to maintain that independence. Thus,
unisons are permitted on weak beats when necessary to make good counterpoint
between the lines.

Any weak-beat dissonance must follow the pattern of the \emph{dissonant
passing tone}, explained below. Also explained below are a number of standard
patterns for consonant weak beats. Chances are high that if your weak beats do
not fit into one of the following patterns, there is a problem with the
counterpoint, so use them as a guide both for composing the counterpoint, and
for evaluating it.

\hypertarget{weak-beat-patterns}{%
\subsection{Weak beat patterns}\label{weak-beat-patterns}}

The following patterns (whose terms are either standard or taken from Salzer
\& Schachter's \emph{Counterpoint in Composition}) should guide your use of
weak-beat notes in a second-species counterpoint line. A good general practice
is to start with a downbeat note, then choose the following downbeat note, and
finally choose a pattern below that will allow you to fill in the space
between downbeats well.

Most of these are used as examples in the demonstration video at the bottom of
the page.

\hypertarget{dissonant-weak-beats}{%
\subsubsection{Dissonant weak beats}\label{dissonant-weak-beats}}

\emph{All dissonant weak beats in second species are dissonant passing tones},
so called because the counterpoint line passes from one consonant downbeat to
another consonant downbeat by stepwise motion. The melodic interval from
downbeat to downbeat in the counterpoint will always be a third, and the
passing tone will come in the middle in order to fill that third with passing
motion.

Since all dissonances in second species are passing tones, you will never leap
into or out of a dissonant tone, nor will you change directions on a dissonant
tone, nor will any dissonances occur on a downbeat.

\hypertarget{consonant-weak-beats}{%
\subsubsection{Consonant weak beats}\label{consonant-weak-beats}}

A \emph{consonant passing tone} outlines a third from downbeat to downbeat,
and has the same pattern as the dissonant passing tone, except that all three
tones (downbeat, passing tone, downbeat) are consonant with the cantus. A
consonant passing tone will always be a sixth or perfect fifth above/below the
cantus.

A \emph{substitution} also outlines a third from downbeat to downbeat.
However, instead of filling it in with stepwise motion, the counterpoint leaps
a fourth and then steps in the opposite direction. It is called a substitution
because it can substitute for a passing tone in a line that needs an extra
leap or change of direction to provide variety. Like the consonant passing
tone, all three notes in the counterpoint must be consonant with the cantus.

A \emph{skipped passing tone} outlines a fourth from downbeat to downbeat. The
weak-beat note divides that fourth into a third and a step. Again, all three
intervals (downbeat, skipped passing tone, downbeat) are consonant with the
cantus.

An \emph{interval subdivision} outlines a fifth or sixth between successive
downbeats. The large, consonant melodic interval between downbeats is divided
into two smaller consonant leaps. A melodic fifth between downbeats would be
divided into two thirds. A melodic sixth between downbeats would be divided
into a third and a fourth, or a fourth and a third. Not only must all three
\emph{melodic} intervals be consonant (both note-to-note intervals and the
downbeat-to-downbeat interval), but each note in the counterpoint must be
consonant with the cantus.

A \emph{change of register} occurs when a large, consonant leap (P5, sixth, or
octave) from strong beat to weak beat is followed by a step in the opposite
direction. It is used to achieve melodic variety after a long stretch of
stepwise motion, to avoid parallels or other problems, or to get out of the
way of the cantus to maintain independence. It should be used infrequently.
And as always, each note must be consonant with the cantus.

A \emph{delay of melodic progression} outlines a step from downbeat to
downbeat. It involves a leap of a third from strong beat to weak beat,
followed by a step in the opposite direction into the following downbeat. It
is called a ``delay'' because it is used to embellish what otherwise is a
slower first-species progression (motion by step from downbeat to downbeat).

A \emph{consonant neighbor tone} occurs when the counterpoint moves by step
from downbeat to weak beat, and then returns to the original pitch on the
following downbeat. If the first downbeat makes a fifth with the cantus, the
consonant neighbor will make a sixth, and \emph{vice versa}.

\textbf{Parallel perfect octaves (PP8)} - What causes this part-writing error?
- Both tones in our example are the leading tone of I--we have doubled thirds!
- Why is this bad? - Lack of voice independency. A bunch of parallel motion
can cause voices to bleed together, and then when they separate again it can
be jarring to the overall texture - If you were going to fix this, how would
you do it? - Have soprano sing a D in the first note of the second measure?
(techincally yes, but it makes a jumpier melody which isn't ideal) - In the
same place, change the tenor to a D instead of the soprano? - Double the G in
the lower two voices? - Have soprano sing a D on the second and third chords?
- BASICALLY: fixing the errors is never as simple as you want it, and there's
a bunch of different ways to do it. Fixing them can be\ldots trial and error
:)

\textbf{Parallel perfect fifths (PP5)} - Still considered a PP5 even in
distant voices? - Yes! Any of these movement errors can happen between any 2
voices

\textbf{Contrary perfect fifths and octaves (CP5, CP8)} - Usually happens when
trying to fix a parallel movement error by moving one voice an octave down. It
isn't ideal to sing and usually creates spacing errors as a result - Red flag:
if there's a HUGE leap in one of the voices, there's probably a contrary P5 or
P8

\textbf{Unacceptable unequal fifths (UU5)} - movement from a d5 to a P5 - must
involve the bass - Red flag: tendency tones not resolving the way they're
supposed to - Ex: in C, B and F resolving to C and G. F is the seventh of a G7
chord and is supposed to resolve downward by step to the third of the next
chord, but it went up to G instead. - There is no octaves version of this one,
fifths only

\textbf{Unacceptable similar fifths and octaves (US5, US8)} - The most
restrictve of these movement errors, so if you look for the specifics it will
be easy to find! - Can only happen in the soprano and bass - Red flag: Skip of
a third or more in the soprano voice + similar motion in soprano and bass -
Second interval must be a P5 or P8. What matters is what interval it lands on,
not what it starts on

\hypertarget{defining-an-interval}{%
\subsection{Defining an Interval}\label{defining-an-interval}}

An \emph{interval} is the distance between two pitches, usually measured as a
number of steps on a scale.

A \emph{dyad} is a pair of pitches sounding together (in other words, a
two-note chord). Since a dyad is defined by the interval between the two
pitches, dyads are often simply called intervals.

Thus, the term \emph{interval} regularly refers both to the distance between
two pitches on a scale and to a dyad whose pitches are separated by that
distance.

\hypertarget{diatonic-intervals}{%
\subsection{Diatonic intervals}\label{diatonic-intervals}}

More commonly for tonal music, we are interested in the number of steps on the
diatonic (major or minor) scale. This is a bit tricky---not because it's
difficult, but because it's counter-intuitive. Unfortunately, the system is
too old and well engrained to change it now! But once you get past the initial
strangeness, diatonic intervals are manageable.

When identifying a diatonic interval, begin with the \emph{letter names only}.
That is, treat C, C-sharp, and C-flat all as \emph{C} for the time being.
Next, count the number of steps (different letters) between the two pitches in
question, \emph{including both pitches in your count}. This gives you the
\emph{generic interval}.

For example, from C4 to E4, counting both C and E, there are three diatonic
steps (three letter names): C, D, E. Thus, the generic interval for C4--E4 is
a \emph{third}. The same is true for any C to any E: C\#4 to E4, Cb4 to E\#4,
etc. They are all diatonic thirds.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/intervals/thirds.png}
\caption{Three kinds of generic thirds.}
\end{figure}

Often more specificity is needed than generic intervals can provide. That
specificity comes in the form of an interval's \emph{quality}. Combining
\emph{quality} with a generic interval name produces a \emph{specific
interval}.

There are five possible interval qualities:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  augmented (A)
\item
  major (M)
\item
  perfect (P)
\item
  minor (m)
\item
  diminished (d)
\end{itemize}

To obtain an interval's quality, find both the generic interval and the
chromatic interval. Then consult the following table to find the specific
interval.

For example, C4--E4 is a generic third, and has a chromatic interval of i4. A
third that encompasses four semitones is a \emph{major third} (M3). Note that
both generic interval and chromatic interval are necessary to find the
specific interval, since there are multiple specific diatonic intervals for
each generic interval and for each chromatic interval.

Note that some generic intervals can be augmented, perfect, or diminished, and
other intervals can be augmented, major, minor, or diminished. There is no
generic interval that can be both major/minor and perfect; if it can be major
or minor, it cannot be perfect, and if it can be perfect, it cannot be major
or minor. An augmented version of an interval is always one semitone wider
than major or perfect; diminished is always one semitone smaller than minor or
perfect.

Solfège can also help to determine the specific interval. Each pair of solfège
syllables will have the same interval, no matter what the key, as long as it
is clear which syllable is the lower pitch and which is the upper pitch.
Memorizing the intervals between solfège pairs can help speed along your
analysis of dyads as they appear in music. For example, knowing that
\emph{do}--\emph{mi}, \emph{fa}--\emph{la}, and \emph{sol}--\emph{ti} are
always major thirds and knowing that \emph{re}--\emph{fa},
\emph{mi}--\emph{sol}, \emph{la}--\emph{do}, and \emph{ti}--\emph{re} are
always minor thirds will allow for faster analysis of dyads in major keys.

\hypertarget{chromatic-intervals}{%
\subsection{Chromatic intervals}\label{chromatic-intervals}}

The simplest way to measure intervals, particularly at the keyboard, is to
count the number of half-steps, or \emph{semitones}, between two pitches. To
determine the chromatic interval between C4 and E4, for example, start at C4
and ascend the chromatic scale to E4, counting steps along the way: C\#4, D4,
D\#4, E4. E4 is four semitones higher than C4. Chromatic intervals are notated
with a lower-case \textbf{i} followed by an Arabic numeral for the number of
semitones. C4--E4 is four semitones, or \textbf{i4}.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{compound-intervals}{%
\subsection{Compound intervals}\label{compound-intervals}}

The intervals discussed above, from unison to octave, are called \emph{simple
intervals}. Any interval larger than an octave is considered a \emph{compound
interval}. Take the interval C4 to E5. The generic interval is a tenth.
However, it functions the same as C4 to E4 in almost all musical
circumstances. Thus, the tenth C4--E5 is also called a \emph{compound third}.
A compound interval takes the same quality as the corresponding simple
interval. If C4--E4 is a major third, then C4--E5 is a major tenth.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/intervals/compound.png}
\caption{Simple and compound major thirds.}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{interval-inversion}{%
\subsection{Interval inversion}\label{interval-inversion}}

In addition to C4--E4 and C4--E5, E4--C5 also shares a similar sound and
musical function. In fact, any dyad that keeps the same two pitch classes but
changes register will have a similar sound and function. However, the fact
that E4--C5 has E as its lowest pitch instead of C means that it has a
different generic interval: E4--C5 is a sixth, not a third. Because of that
difference, it will also play a different musical function in some
circumstances. However, there is no escaping the relationship.

Dyads formed by the same two pitch classes, but with different pitch classes
on bottom and on top, are said to be \emph{inversions} of each other, because
the pitch classes are \emph{inverted}. Likewise, the intervals marked off by
those inverted dyads are said to be \emph{inversions} of each other.

Again, take C4--E4 (major third) and E4--C5 (minor sixth). These two dyads
have the same two pitch classes, but one has C on bottom and E on top, while
the other has E on bottom and C on top. Thus, they are inversions of each
other.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/intervals/inversion.png}
\caption{Inversion relationship: major third and minor sixth.}
\end{figure}

Three relationships exhibited by these two dyads hold for all interval
inversions.

First, the chromatic intervals add up to 12. (C4--E4 = i4; E4--C5 = i8; i4 +
i8 = i12) This is because the two intervals add up to an octave (with an
overlap on E4).

Second, \emph{the two generic interval values add up to nine} (a third plus a
sixth, or 3 + 6). This is because the two intervals add up to an octave (8),
and one of the notes is counted twice when you add them together. (Remember
the counterintuitive way of counting off diatonic intervals, where the number
includes the starting and ending pitches, and when combining inverted
intervals, there is always one note that gets counted twice---in this case,
E4.)

Lastly, the major interval inverts into a minor, and vice versa. This always
holds for interval inversion. Likewise, an augmented interval's inversion is
always diminished, and vice versa. A perfect interval's inversion is always
perfect.

\begin{quote}
major ↔ minor\\
augmented ↔ diminished\\
perfect ↔ perfect
\end{quote}

Interval inversion may seem confusing and esoteric now, but it will be an
incredibly important concept for the study of voice-leading and the study of
harmony.

\hypertarget{methods-for-learning-intervals}{%
\subsection{Methods for learning
intervals}\label{methods-for-learning-intervals}}

Ultimately, \href{intervals.html}{intervals} need to be committed to memory,
both aurally and visually. There are, however, a few tricks to learning this
quickly. One such trick is the so-called \emph{white-key method}.

\hypertarget{white-key-method}{%
\subsubsection{White-Key Method}\label{white-key-method}}

The \emph{white-key method} requires you to memorize all of the intervals
found between the white keys on the piano (or simply all of the intervals in
the key of C major). Once you've learned these, any interval can be calculated
as an alteration of a white-key interval. For example, we can figure out the
interval D4-F\#4 if we know that the interval D4-F4 is a minor third, and this
interval has been made one semitone larger: a major third.

Conveniently, there is a lot of repetition of interval size and quality among
white-key intervals. Memorize the most frequent type, and the exceptions.

All of the seconds are \emph{major} except for two: E-F, and B-C, which are
\emph{minor}.

All of the thirds are \emph{minor} except for three: C-E, F-A, and G-B, which
are \emph{major}.

All of the fourths are \emph{perfect} except for one: F-B, which is
\emph{augmented}.

Believe it or not, you now know \emph{all} of the white-key intervals, as long
as you understand the concept of \emph{interval inversion}. For example, if
you know that all seconds are major except for E-F and B-C (which are minor),
then you know that all \emph{sevenths} are minor except for F-E and C-B (which
are major).

Once you've mastered the white-key intervals, you can figure out any other
interval by adjusting the size accordingly.

\hypertarget{melodic-and-harmonic-intervals}{%
\subsection{Melodic and harmonic
intervals}\label{melodic-and-harmonic-intervals}}

The last distinction between interval types to note is \emph{melodic} v.
\emph{harmonic} intervals. This distinction is simple. If the two pitches of a
dyad sound at the same time (a two-note chord), the interval between them is a
\emph{harmonic interval}. If the two pitches in question are sounded
back-to-back (as in a melody), the interval between them is a \emph{melodic
interval}. This distinction is important in voice-leading, where different
intervals are preferred or forbidden in harmonic contexts than in melodic
contexts. The difference is also important for listening, as hearing melodic
and harmonic intervals of the same quality requires different techniques.

\hypertarget{consonance-and-dissonance}{%
\subsection{Consonance and dissonance}\label{consonance-and-dissonance}}

Intervals are categorized as \emph{consonant} or \emph{dissonant} based on
their sound (how stable, sweet, or harsh they sound), how easy they are to
sing, and how they best function in a passage (beginning, middle, end; between
certain other intervals; etc.). Different standards apply to melody and
harmony. The following categories will be essential for your work in strict
voice-leading, and they will be a helpful guide for free composition and
arranging work, as well.

\textbf{Melodic consonance and dissonance}

The following \emph{melodic} intervals are \emph{consonant}, and can be used
in strict voice-leading both for successive pitches and as boundaries of
stepwise progressions in a single direction:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  All perfect intervals (P4, P5, P8)\\
\item
  All diatonic steps (M2, m2)\\
\item
  Major and minor thirds\\
\item
  Major and minor sixths
\end{itemize}

All other \emph{melodic} intervals are \emph{dissonant}, and must be avoided
for successive pitches and as boundaries of stepwise progressions in a single
direction, including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  All augmented and diminished intervals (including those that are
  enharmonically equivalent to consonant intervals, such as A2 and A1)\\
\item
  All sevenths
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Harmonic consonance and dissonance}

The following \emph{harmonic} intervals are \emph{imperfect consonances}, and
can be used relatively freely in strict voice-leading (except for beginnings
and endings):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Major and minor thirds\\
\item
  Major and minor sixths
\end{itemize}

The following \emph{harmonic} intervals are \emph{perfect consonances}, and
must be used with care in limited circumstances in strict voice-leading:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  All perfect intervals \emph{except the perfect fourth} (P1, P5, P8)
\end{itemize}

All other \emph{harmonic} intervals are \emph{dissonant}, and must be employed
in very specific ways in strict voice-leading, including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  All diatonic steps (M2, m2)\\
\item
  All augmented and diminished intervals (including those that are
  enharmonically equivalent to consonant intervals, such as A2 and A1)\\
\item
  All sevenths
\item
  Perfect fourths
\end{itemize}

Note: \^{} symbol indicates superscript text. How we're ``supposed'' to

not care whether you interpret C\^{}11 as adding an 11th or a 4th, whereas
others will \emph{specifically} want an 11th because of how its sound differs
from a 4th

way

\textbf{What do we sub out in a sub chord?} - Whatever is closest! Ex: C (sub

\textbf{Why is leadsheet notation important for our class?} - Another way of

\hypertarget{lead-sheet-symbols}{%
\subsubsection{Lead-sheet symbols}\label{lead-sheet-symbols}}

A triad can be summed up by a single symbol, such as a lead-sheet chord
symbol. A lead sheet symbol includes information about both root quality, as
well as which pitch class occurs in the lowest voice (called the \emph{bass}
regardless of who is singing or playing that pitch).

A lead-sheet symbol begins with a capital letter (and, if necessary, an
accidental) denoting the root of the chord. That letter is followed by
information about a chord's quality:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  major triad: no quality symbol is added
\item
  minor triad: lower-case ``m''
\item
  diminished triad: lower-case ``dim'' or a degree sign ``°''
\item
  augmented triad: lower-case ``aug'' or a plus sign ``+''
\end{itemize}

Finally, if a pitch class other than the chord root is the lowest note in the
chord, a slash is added, followed by a capital letter denoting the pitch class
in the bass (lowest) voice.

A C-major triad's lead-sheet symbol is simply \textbf{C}. A C-minor triad is
\textbf{Cm}. A D-sharp-diminished triad with an F-sharp in the bass is
\textbf{D\#dim/F\#}. And so on.

\hypertarget{syncopation-1}{%
\subsection{Syncopation}\label{syncopation-1}}

\emph{Syncopation} occurs when a rhythmic pattern that typically occurs on
strong beats or strong parts of the beat occurs instead on weak beats or weak
parts of the beat. Most pop/rock songs have a mixture of syncopated and
``straight'' rhythms. The syncopated rhythms are usually easy to sing, since
they often match speech better than straight rhythms. However, they are more
difficult than straight rhythms to sight-sing, dictate, or transcribe.

\hypertarget{straight-syncopations}{%
\section{Straight syncopations}\label{straight-syncopations}}

In contemporary pop/rock music, syncopation typically involves taking a series
of notes of equal durations, cutting the duration of the first note in half,
and shifting the rest early by that half duration.

For example, a series of four quarter notes, all sounding on the beat, can be
transformed in this way by making the first note into an eighth note, and
sounding each successive quarter note on eighth note early---all on the
\emph{offbeats}.

This process can occur on any metrical level. If the duration of the series of
``straight'' notes is two beats, they will be syncopated by changing the first
note to a single beat and shifting each other note early by a beat. If the
duration of the straight notes, like the figure above, is a beat, they will be
syncopated by a division (one half beat in simple meter). If the straight
notes are each divisions, they will be syncopated by shifting each note by a
subdivision. The unit of syncopation (the duration of the first note, and the
amount of shift applied to the following notes) is always half of the duration
of the straight notes. All of these syncopations are realtively common in
contemporary pop/rock music.

As a convention, when we take a series of notes that each have a duration of
one beat and shift them early by half of a beat, we will call that
\emph{beat-level syncopation}. When we take a series of notes that each have a
duration of one division and shift them early by a subdivision, we will call
that \emph{division-level syncopation}.

\emph{Beat-level syncopation.}\\

\emph{Division-level syncopation.}\\
\href{images/syncopation/eighthToSixteenth.png}{\includegraphics{images/syncopation/eighthToSixteenth.png}}

(Note the use of ties to make each beat clear. Always do this in order to make
it easy to read.)

\hypertarget{transcribing-straight-syncopations}{%
\section{Transcribing straight
syncopations}\label{transcribing-straight-syncopations}}

Straight syncopated rhythms are easily identified by the frequently occuring
off-beat rhythms. For example, if you conduct or tap the counting pulse while
listening to a song, several notes in a row that are articulated between your
taps or conducted beats, with no notes articulated simultaneously with the
counting pulse, indicate syncopation.

Once you identify a syncopated passage---which may only involve two or three
notes---figure out on what metrical level the syncopation occurs. For example,
in simple meter, if no notes are articulated directly on the counting pulse
beats and one note is articulated in between each beat, the syncopation is
occuring at the beat level. If no notes are articulated directly on the
counting pulse beats and \emph{two notes} are articulated in between each
beat, listen to the passage again while tapping the \emph{division}. If no
notes are articulated directly on the division taps and one note is
articulated in between each tap, the syncopation is occuring at the division
level.

Once you have determined the metrical level on which the syncopation occurs,
determine the durational value of the shift. If the syncopation occurs on the
beat level (one note sounding between each counting pulse beat), the value of
syncopation is a division: each beat-length note has been shifted one division
early. If the syncopation occurs on the division level, the value of
syncopation is a subdivision: each division-length note has been shifted one
subdivision early.

Lastly, determine how the syncopated pattern begins. Does the offbeat pattern
simply begin offbeat? Or does the pattern begin with two quick notes
back-to-back as above---one short note on the beat followed by the first of
the longer syncopated notes?

Once you have determinted the level of syncopation, the duration of the shift,
and whether or not the pattern begins with a truncated onbeat note, the
rhythmic pattern should be easy to notate. If, however, you are still having
difficulty, try using the lyric syllables and the stress patterns of the
lyrics to help you keep track of the individual notes and which ones are
on/offbeat. Writing lyrics down before notating the rhythm can be a big help.

\hypertarget{fake-triplets}{%
\section{Fake triplets}\label{fake-triplets}}

Another common rhythmic pattern in pop/rock is to divide a beat (or two beats)
into three almost-equal groups. For example, dividing a half note into two
dotted-eighth notes and an eighth note (3+3+2). Since this pattern
approximates a triplet while still maintaining the simple division of beats by
2, 4, 8, etc., we can call them \emph{fake triplets}.

\includegraphics{/images/syncopation/fakeTripletsBar.png}

\includegraphics{/images/syncopation/fakeTripletsHalfBar.png}

Fake triplets are more common than ``real'' triplets in most pop/rock genres,
but both do occur, so take care to distinguish between the two. ``Cathedrals''
by Jump, Little Children contains examples of both (as well as some straight
syncopation), and is an excellent example for practicing performing and
identifying fake and real triplets.

While fake triplets occur most often in 3+3+2 groupings, 3+2+3 and 2+3+3 are
also possible.

A related pattern is what we might call \emph{fake sextuplets}. Here the 3+3+2
pattern is doubled, resulting in 3+3+3+3+2+2.

\includegraphics{/images/syncopation/fakeSextuplets.png}

In the opening of ``Electric Co.'' by U2, the guitar plays subdivisions
(sixteenths) grouped 3+3+3+3+2+2, while the kick drum plays straight beats
(quarters) under the hi-hat playing straight subdivisions.

What strategies are you using to voice these progressions with modal mixture?

-Try to find stepwise motion in each voice. Voice leading!

-Write parts chord by chord? or write parts one voice at a time?

-Keep in mind our traditional voice leading rules. We want to keep our voices
independent.

-Start from the beginning? (maybe not) The voice leading can be easier to
manage if you start from the end and work backwards.

-In a weird kind of way, smooth voice leading trumps function and can make
these progressions with modal mixture sound convincing. ii should not go to I
by our traditional rules, but ii\%7 sure can because it has such good voice
leading.

Modal Mixture or non-chord tone?

-Look for whether or not it is on or off the beat. This can determine the
strength of the chromatic pitch

-Is it in the melody? If so, it can be heard as a passing tone.

-Look at the duration of the pitch. A longer note could more easily be argued
into being a chord tone of modal mixture.

\subsection{Combining Periods and
Sentences}\label{combining-periods-and-sentences}}

Hybrid themes mixes the \href{themeFunctions.html}{functional features} of
\href{sentence.html}{sentences} and \href{period.html}{periods}. William
Caplin has identified four primary types:

\hypertarget{hybrid-1}{%
\subsubsection{Hybrid 1}\label{hybrid-1}}

Hybrid 1 combines an \href{themeFunctions.html\#antecedent}{antecedent phrase}
with a \href{themeFunctions.html\#continuation}{continuation phrase}.

Antecedent + Continuation: Mozart, Piano Sonata in C major, K. 330 II, mm.
1--8

A prototypical example is found in the first eight measures of Mozart's Piano
Sonata in C major, II. The antecedent phrase contains a basic idea
characterized by the repeated notes forming its anacrusis. This is followed by
a contrasting idea formed from a scalar ascent leading to the phrase's half
cadence in m. 4. Following the antecedent phrase, the music begins to express
continuation function, primarily through fragmentation and an increase in
surface rhythm. In the middle of m. 6, the characteristic melodic motives are
liquidated into conventional scalar figuration leading to a V:PAC.

\hypertarget{hybrid-2}{%
\subsubsection{Hybrid 2}\label{hybrid-2}}

Hybrid 2 combines an antecedent phrase with a four-measure cadential
progression.

Antecedent + Cadential: Haydn, String Quartet in G major, Hob. III:66, II, mm.
1--8

Here, the four measures subsequent to the antecedent support a single
cadential progression:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{I6 ii6/5 V I}
\end{quote}

Notice that this four-measure phrase does not display any markers of
\href{themeFunctions.html\#continuation}{continuation function}.

\hypertarget{the-compound-basic-idea}{%
\subsubsection{The Compound Basic Idea}\label{the-compound-basic-idea}}

Just as we sometimes find composers combining different features of the two
primary thematic types, we also often find combinations of different types of
phrase. The ``compound basic idea,'' or CBI, combines the melodic
characteristics of the \href{themeFunctions.html\#antecedent}{antecedent
function} with the harmonic characteristics of the
\href{themeFunctions.html\#presentation}{presentation} function. Like an
antecedent, it presents a basic idea followed by a contrasting one. But like a
presentation, the compound basic idea simply prolongs tonic, without ending in
a cadence.

\hypertarget{hybrid-3}{%
\subsubsection{Hybrid 3}\label{hybrid-3}}

The third hybrid type strongly resembles the
\href{hybridThemes.html\#hybrid-1}{first hybrid}. Rather than beginning with
an initiating antecedent, however, its first phrase is a
\href{hybridThemes.html\#the-compound-basic-idea}{CBI}. Following the CBI,
Hybrid 3 concludes with a continuation that ends with a cadence.

Compound Basic Idea + Continuation: Beethoven, Violin Sonata, Op. 30, No.~2,
III, mm. 1--8

In this example, from Beethoven's Violin Sonata, Op. 30, the melodic structure
of the initiating phrase contains two contrasting ideas, each of which begins
with the same dotted figure. However, unlike a typical antecedent, the phrase
only prolongs tonic as the V6 on the last beat of m. 3 only decorates the
tonic through a lower neighbor motion rather than creating cadential
articulation. Thus, the phrase is best understood as a
\href{hybridThemes.html\#the-compound-basic-idea}{``compound basic idea.''}

The concluding phrase is a typical continuation expressed through
fragmentation, melodic sequence, and increased harmonic rhythm.

\hypertarget{hybrid-4}{%
\subsubsection{Hybrid 4}\label{hybrid-4}}

Hybrid 4 resembles the period, with the exception that the first phrase is
comprised of a ``compound basic idea'' rather than an antecedent. Following
the \href{hybridThemes.html\#the-compound-basic-idea}{CBI}, the concluding
phrase expresses the function of a consequent, typically altering the return
of the contrasting idea so that the theme ends with a strong cadence.

Compound Basic Idea + Consequent: Beethoven, String Quartet in G major, Op.
18/2, IV., mm. 1--8

The cello's presentation of the initiating phrase contains two distinct
melodic ideas. But this phrase's conclusion, on the C4 in m. 4, is not
sufficient to create cadential closure. When the remaining strings enter in m.
5, they work through the same basic and contrasting ideas, but are able to
create a I:PAC to close the consequent phrase.

\hypertarget{compound-periods}{%
\subsubsection{Compound Periods}\label{compound-periods}}

The compound period (also called the \emph{16-bar period} because its typical
form is 16 bars long) is made of \emph{two themes} instead of \emph{two
phrases}. Like an \href{period.html}{8-bar period}, the two halves of the
compound period exhibit \href{themeFunctions.html\#antecedent}{antecedent} and
\href{themeFunctions.html\#consequent}{consequent} function. To distinguish
them, we will call these ``large antecedents'' and ``large consequents.''

The thematic types available to the two halves of the compound period must be
conducive to the functions of antecedent and consequent. Thus,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the initiating phrase of the \emph{large antecedent}, usually four bars
  long, will act as a basic idea - either presentation, antecedent, or
  compound basic idea;\\
\item
  the concluding half, also typically four bars long, will act as a
  contrasting idea and will always be a continuation;\\
\item
  the \emph{large consequent} should return the BI from the first theme (often
  varied), and its concluding CI will end with a strong cadence.
\end{itemize}

These functional requirements tend to result in three types of compound
period.

\hypertarget{a-compound-period-comprised-of-two-sentences}{%
\subsubsection{A Compound Period Comprised of Two
Sentences}\label{a-compound-period-comprised-of-two-sentences}}

Both sentences in the compound period will have the same basic idea, each
exhibiting presentation function. In the first sentence, the presentation is
followed by a continuation that ends with a weak cadence. In the second, the
continuation culminates in a strong cadence, most commonly a PAC.

Compound Period (Sent. + Sent.): Mozart, Piano Sonata in D major, K. 284, II,
mm. 1--8

The large antecedent is constructed as a sentence whose basic idea is a
presentation and whose contrasting idea is a continuation. Following the HC in
m. 8, the next phrase restates the presentational basic idea in varied form.
The final four measures culminate in a PAC.

\hypertarget{a-compound-period-comprised-of-two-hybrids}{%
\subsubsection{A Compound Period Comprised of Two
Hybrids}\label{a-compound-period-comprised-of-two-hybrids}}

If the initiating phrase is composed of an antecedent, rather than a
presentation, the 8-bar antecedent phrase will be a hybrid of the
\href{hybridThemes.html\#hybrid-1}{``antecedent + continuation''} variety.

Compound Period (Hybrid 1 + Hybrid 1): Mozart, Piano Sonata in F major, K.
332, I, mm. 41--56

In this example the large antecedent begins with a small antecedent,
comprising mm. 41-44, that acts as a basic idea. In the large consequent, this
basic idea returns (mm. 49-52) in varied form.

By contrast, if the initiating phrase is composed of a
\href{hybridThemes.html\#the-compound-basic-idea}{``compound basic idea''},
the large antecedent will be a type-3 hybrid: compound basic idea +
continuation. This type of compound period is \emph{very similar} to the
previous variety. The only distinction is that the initiating phrase will not
culminate in a cadence, thus giving the theme's initiation a looser quality.

\hypertarget{compound-sentences}{%
\subsection{Compound Sentences}\label{compound-sentences}}

The compound (or 16-bar) sentence expands both the presentation and
continuation phrases of a regular \href{sentence.html}{sentence} to a length
of eight bars each.

Each 2-bar basic idea is replaced by a 4-bar
\href{hybridThemes.html\#the-compound-basic-idea}{compound basic idea} in the
expanded presentation.

A ``typical'' continuation would have approximately four bars of continuation
function followed by four bars of cadential function, but in a compound
sentence, this varies greatly. The continuation is commonly shortened or
\href{internalExpansions.html}{expanded}.

The eight bars that comprise the continuation of the main theme below are
constructed from two compound basic ideas, the first beginning on tonic and
moving to dominant (mm. 1-4), and the second beginning with dominant harmony
and moving back to tonic (mm. 5-8).

Initially, the continuation seems as if it will end after only 4 bars, in m.
12. But the clarinet is missing at the the downbeat of m. 12, and instead
begins a link to a \href{internalExpansions.html\#phrase-expansion}{four-bar
repetition}. In this repetition (mm. 13-16), the clarinet melody from mm.
9--12 is played by the piano, who cadences clearly with a PAC at the downbeat
of m. 16.

\textbf{Harmonizing consecutive seventh chords} - We have some weird voice
leading happening between the first and second chords - This is how we set up
a seventh chord sequence, where instead of thirds resolving upward to the root
of the next, they remain static, become sevenths, and then resolve \emph{down}
to the third of the chord after that in circle of fifths progressions. - All
you have to do to turn ii7 into a V7/V is raise the third, then add a natural
to the F in the G7 after that. This looks weird on paper and sucks to sight
read, but for the purposes of harmonic analysis we write it this way.

\textbf{Consecutive secondary dominant chords} - It's that fancy thirds to
sevenths through static motion thing again!! - Sequences of consecutive
secondary dominants can work well if you know what you're doing! Don't try and
do this with secondary leading tone chords though, that can get really messy
really quickly because voice leading for one on its own is already a
nightmare. When in doubt, remember to keep it simple

\textbf{Secondary dominants and their related chords} - V/V and ii - V/ii and
vi - V/vi and iii - For all of these, you identify them by listening to/noting
the quality of the chord. Secondary dominants are always going to be major,
while all their counterparts listed above (aka normalsauce variants) will be
minor

\textbf{Deceptive resolutions of secondary dominant functions} - V7/vi should
resolve to vi, but we have it going to IV instead which is weird - It's a
deceptive progression!! V7/vi - IV is V - VI in C's relative minor, A minor -
To ID this correctly, be looking for a secondary dominant chord that\ldots{} -
Doesn't go where it's supposed to - Is followed by a root position chord WITH
root movement up by step

\hypertarget{class-discussion-55}{%
\chapter{Class discussion}\label{class-discussion-55}}

\textbf{Secondary function pivot chord} - What do we do when there is no good
pivot chord? Like both of them are \emph{really} ugly? - We pivot on a
secondary function chord, which isn't ideal but, hey, it works. In our Bach
example, we debated modulating on one chord vs.~the other: the F chord, or the
B0/D. Ultimately, 99\% of the time pivoting on the B0/D is gonna be the move:
we end up with vii06/ii in Bb and vii06 in the new key, C minor. This is a
more sudden, dramatic sound than a common chord pivot modulation - Secondary
function pivot chords are obviously possible, but if you can use a common
chord pivot modulation (where both IDs are diatonic) use that instead! It's
better. - Again, you will usually see pivot modulations in the middle of a
phrase. This is because they have to have a functional progression on both
sides of the pivot.

\textbf{Direct modulation/Phrase modulation} - Pretty common in Broadway and
country music. It's that thing where you repeat everything you just did but up
a step or a up a third! - The signal for this modulation is, to nobody's
surprise, the end of a phrase. This requires a cadence: phrases are defined by
cadences, so you \emph{have} to have a cadence right before a phrase
modulation. - After this they can modulate pretty much wherever, but a lot of
times you get a modulation to the iii/III because it's a really dramatic
sound, since I and iii are so far away from each other - This type of
modulation is not labeled with a bracket. Instead, you designate the new key
in the same line as the old one and continue as normal

\textbf{Common tone modulation} - Requires a bracket to label, but instead of
the chord you label the common tones used to move between keys. We label the
scale degrees, putting the scale degree in the old key above the bracket while
we put the new one below (make sure to use \^{} to designate the numbers as
scale degrees!!) - Ex: in the Schubert excerpt we looked at in class, we
modulate in the third to last measure, using the C\# in the melody and the
piano as our common tone. We're moving from D minor to F\# major, so we would
put ``\^{}7'' in the upper part of the bracket, then ``F\#: \^{}5'' in the
lower part. Remember that even though you're labeling pitches instead of
chords with this type of modulation, you still designate the new key in the
same way as with a pivot modulation.

Prime form is useful for making pitch class sets easy to compare with other
pitch class sets.

Prime form is also another way we can say that pitch class sets are related.
Now we can say they are related by transposition, inversion, and/or same prime
form.

So our normal form is {[}3,4,8,t{]}. Take the normal form and set it on zero:
{[}0,1,5,7{]}. NOW invert the original normal form. - {[}3,4,8,t{]} to
(9,8,4,2). - find the inversion's normal form: - (2,4,8,9) / 7 - (4,8,9,2) /
10 - (8,9,2,4) / 8 - (9,2,4,8) / 11 - our normal form for the inversion is
{[}2,4,8,9{]}.

And set the inversion's normal form on zero {[}0,2,6,7{]}. NOW you compare the
two normal forms on zero. - {[}0,1,5,7{]} and {[}0,2,6,7{]} - first you find
the smallest interval between the first and 4th intergers (in this case it is
the same). - then you check the interval between the first and 3rd intergers

\hypertarget{set-class-relationships}{%
\subsection{Set class relationships}\label{set-class-relationships}}

Lots of concepts in pitch-class set theory are best viewed along a sliding
scale of ``concreteness'' or ``abstractness.'' A concept like \emph{pitch},
for example, is very concrete, while \emph{pitch class} is somewhat more
abstract. We can perform a pitch, but we can't really perform a pitch class.
We've seen similar examples in the intervallic realm. Ordered pitch intervals
are associated with a very specific sound (e.g., +15); unordered pitch-class
intervals (e.g., interval class 1) are less vivid or real. A basic concept in
pitch-class set theory is that these levels of concreteness and abstractness
encompass not only pitch and interval, but groups of pitch classes as well.
These groups of pitch classes are called \emph{pitch-class sets}.

We've already seen sets of pitch-classes, though we haven't really been
calling them that. When we extract a group of notes from a passage of music
and put them in ``{[}normal order{]}{[}1{]},'' that group of notes is a
pitch-class set. As we've seen in class, one very interesting way of looking
at a lot of post-tonal music is by studying the {[}transpositional{]}{[}2{]}
and {[}inversional{]}{[}3{]} relationships between pitch-class sets. In the
short example below (from Bartók's ``Subject and Reflection'') you'll notice
that the right hand of the two passages is \emph{T5}-related, as is the
left-hand. Within each passage, the right and left hands are \_T8I \_and
\emph{T6I} related, respectively.

\href{/images/postTonal/subjecdtAndReflection.png}{\includegraphics{/images/postTonal/subjecdtAndReflection.png}}

\emph{In order for a pitch-class set to be transpositionally or inversionally
related to some other pitch class set, they must share the same collection of
intervals}. This is most easily grasped by remembering that all major and
minor triads have the same interval content (M3, m3, and P5). Major triads are
transpositionally related to one another, while major and minor triads are
inversionally related to one another. The same observation applies in Bartók's
``Subject and Reflection.'' The four pitch-class sets in those two passages
all have the same intervallic content and that's why we can label
transpositional and inversional relationships between them.

All pitch-class sets that are transpositionally and inversionally related
belong to the same \emph{set class}, and they are represented by the same
\emph{prime form}. We follow a simple process to put a pitch-class set in
prime form:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Put the pitch-class set in normal order.
\item
  Transpose it so that the first pitch class is 0.
\item
  Invert the results from step 2 (any inversion will work) and put the result
  in normal order.
\item
  Transpose it so that the first pitch class is 0.
\item
  Compare the results of steps (2) and (4). Prime form is the most compact
  version.
\end{enumerate}

The example below walks demonstrates using the motive from Bartók's ``Subject
and Reflection.''

\href{/images/postTonal/primeForm.png}{\includegraphics{/images/postTonal/primeForm.png}}

\hypertarget{prime-form-2}{%
\subsection{Prime form}\label{prime-form-2}}

\emph{Analytically}, the concept of set class is useful because it can show
coherence in a composition. Bartók's ``{[}Subject and Reflection{]}{[}1{]},''
for example, uses the (02357) set class nearly exclusively---though it appears
in many transpositions and inversions.

\emph{Theoretically}, the concept is useful because it provides a prism
through which we can begin to study the \emph{possibilities} provided to us by
the twelve pitch-class universe. For almost 500 years, composers mostly used
only a small subset of those possibilities (triads, seventh chords, and so
forth). Set class lists reveals all of the other possibilities. They also give
us hints as to why tonal composers used only a small portion of them and
suggest entire worlds organized through other means. Fortunately for us, we
don't need to create such a list because many others have! A particularly good
list is found {[}here{]}{[}2{]}, and I'll give you another to keep in class.

Most of these set-class lists are organized similarly. Set classes that have
the same number of notes in them (we say that they have the same
``cardinality'') are grouped together: trichords (three-note pitch-class sets)
sit together, as do nonachords (nine-note pitch-class sets), and so on.

\href{/images/postTonal/trichordsAndNonachords.png}{\includegraphics{/images/postTonal/trichordsAndNonachords.png}}

Prime form for each set class is show in parenthesis. The ``Forte Number''
(3-1, 9-1, etc.), often adjacent to the prime form, was given to each set
class by the famous music theorist {[}Allen Forte{]}{[}4{]}, who was one of
the first to describe the set class list.

\hypertarget{interval-class-vector}{%
\subsection{Interval Class Vector}\label{interval-class-vector}}

The interval class vector next to each set class's prime form is particularly
valuable. Think of it as a numeric representation of the ``intervallic
flavor'' of each set class. IC vectors have six places \textless\_ \_ \_ \_ \_
\_\textgreater{} that are placeholders for interval classes 1--6. If a set
class has a single interval class 1, it will have the digit 1 in the interval
class vectors first placeholder. The IC vector \textless001110\textgreater,
for example describes a trichord with 1 interval class 3, 1 interval class 4,
and 1 interval class 5; that is, the major or minor triad, set class (037)!

\textbf{First- and third-inversion chords in circle-of-fifths progressions} -
I - V6 - I - Melody: C D C. Can't use C B C because we end up with a PP8 -
Inner voices: alto voice is really the only one with options. D or G on the
second beat are both fine, but the latter has a skip. - I - V6/5 - I - Melody:
C D C again - Inner voices: we started with G F E in T, but this creates a
spacing error. Keeping it simple with G G G instead takes care of that - I
V4/2 - I6 - Third inversion chords in this type of progression will always
move to a first inversion chord because chordal sevenths resolve down to the
third of the next chord

\textbf{Voicing a viio using functional substitution} - Can't double the root
of a viio because it's a tendency tone - The fifth is acting as the chordal
seventh and follows the same resolution rules. Ex: in C, viio is B diminished.
The fifth of the chord, F, will resolve down by step to E in I - Frustrated
sevenths are not a thing. We can only have a frustrated leading tone - Don't
try and do viio in root position. As demonstrated in class, it doesn't really
work--we tried multiple inner voicings and all of them had a bunch of errors -
I - viio - V6/5 - I - This is the one time you can double the fifth in a root
position viio because it will result in a doubled root for V6/5, but
honestly\ldots it's better to try and avoid them whenever possible

\textbf{Using functional substitutions for pre-dominants} - 1: I - IV - V - I
- For the IV, we have to take out the D. - 2: I - ii6 - V - I - We have to
take out the C because ii is no longer a IV. t - To avoid this, double the
third in ii6! ii and IV, as explained before, are similar in the same way as V
and viio. ii6 can follow the same doubling rules as IV--its third is IV's
root, which we saw in \#1 - 3: I - ii6/5 - V - I - Voicing for ii6/5, SATB: C
D A (F). - Essentially: this is a rare thing, much like a frustrated leading
tone, but it's still good to know about for the purposes of analysis. This one
also happens a lot, so it's especially good to know about in advance

\textbf{Function} - Primary: tonic, dominant, predominant. When we assign
these to chords in a progression, we're saying they fill a certain slot -
Secondary: chords that borrow the functions of primary chords - Tertiary:
using a chord in a way that has nothing to do with primary or secondary
function. There are four kinds, but today we're only talking about passing
chords

\textbf{Passing chords} - Creates passing motion. If you identify a chord as
``passing,'' you're saying it has no primary function. Instead, we're using it
for smooth voice leading. To ID these chords, you put the Roman numeral in
parentheses and write ``passing'' underneath it - Like other tertiary
functions, these extend the primary functions on either side of them. If you
insert a passing chord between two dominant function chords, you've simply
lengthened the dominant section - V6 - IV6 - V. We made the IV6 a vi and V6 to
vi is good, but vi to V is not\ldots. so we label it a passing chord. -
There's no good option for this one, really\ldots each one has its own errors,
whether actual or just ``not ideal,'' so it's a matter of picking the one that
is the least bad

For many people, the terms \emph{tone row} and \emph{matrix} are synonymous
with post-tonal theory. Luckily, your basic understanding of set theory
comprehending tone rows fairly simple.

\hypertarget{starting-small}{%
\section{Starting small}\label{starting-small}}

Let's use set classes as a way to build up to understanding tone rows. To do
this, start by writing out each unique, normal-form pc set represented in the
set class of (013). Use your ability to transpose and invert that pc set to
find them quickly. You can also think of this as listing every pc set
represented by a single prime form.

\hypertarget{conclusion-23}{%
\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-23}}

Because of your study of prime form, you probably realized that there are
twenty-four possibilities. Because each of the pc sets will be in normal form,
we know that there is only \emph{one} pc set for each possible starting pitch.
We can represent these using transposition notation. - T0{[}0,1,3{]} =
{[}0,1,3{]} - T1{[}0,1,3{]} = {[}1,2,4{]} - T2{[}0,1,3{]} = {[}2,3,5{]} -
T3{[}0,1,3{]} = {[}3,4,6{]} - T4{[}0,1,3{]} = {[}4,5,7{]} - T5{[}0,1,3{]} =
{[}5,6,8{]} - T6{[}0,1,3{]} = {[}6,7,9{]} - T7{[}0,1,3{]} = {[}7,8,t{]} -
T8{[}0,1,3{]} = {[}8,9,e{]} - T9{[}0,1,3{]} = {[}9,t,0{]} - Tt{[}0,1,3{]} =
{[}t,e,1{]} - Te{[}0,1,3{]} = {[}e,0,2{]}

There are a further twelve unique pc sets that result from inverting our prime
form pc set. Of course, for each of these, you should normalize the pc set
after inversion. - T0I{[}0,1,3{]} = {[}9,e,0{]} - T1I{[}0,1,3{]} = {[}t,0,1{]}
- T2I{[}0,1,3{]} = {[}e,1,2{]} - T3I{[}0,1,3{]} = {[}0,2,3{]} - T4I{[}0,1,3{]}
= {[}1,3,4{]} - T5I{[}0,1,3{]} = {[}2,4,5{]} - T6I{[}0,1,3{]} = {[}3,5,6{]} -
T7I{[}0,1,3{]} = {[}4,6,7{]} - T8I{[}0,1,3{]} = {[}5,7,8{]} - T9I{[}0,1,3{]} =
{[}6,8,9{]} - TtI{[}0,1,3{]} = {[}7,9,t{]} - TeI{[}0,1,3{]} = {[}8,t,e{]}

Each one of these twenty-four pc sets contains a unique collection of pitch
classes.

\hypertarget{visually-representing-a-set-class}{%
\section{Visually representing a set
class}\label{visually-representing-a-set-class}}

In the above example, you could describe T0 and T0I as the reverse order of
the same \emph{intervals} moving away from a central pitch. The only obvious
correlation between the actual \emph{pitch classes} is that both of the pc
sets contain 0--which happens to be the interval of transposition for those
two sets. (The interval of transposition is the ``0'' in T0.) If you look at
each pair of transposed and inverted pc sets, you will notice the same thing;
they always center the interval of transposition. If you wanted to represent
this visually, you could plot each transposition and inversion on a chart, on
which this central, shared pitch for each transposition shows the inversion
and transposition branching out. Look at our trichords charted this way.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lllllll@{}}
\toprule
Inv pc set & inv pc 1 & inv pc 2 & \textbf{common pc} & tran pc 2 & tran pc 3
& Tran pc set \\
\midrule
\endhead
T0I & 9 & e & 0 & 1 & 3 & T0 \\
T1I & t & 0 & 1 & 2 & 4 & T1 \\
T2I & e & 1 & 2 & 3 & 5 & T2 \\
T3I & 0 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 6 & T3 \\
T4I & 1 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 7 & T4 \\
T1I & 2 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 8 & T5 \\
T6I & 3 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 9 & T6 \\
T7I & 4 & 6 & 7 & 8 & t & T7 \\
T8I & 5 & 7 & 8 & 9 & e & T8 \\
T9I & 6 & 8 & 9 & t & 0 & T9 \\
TtI & 7 & 9 & t & e & 1 & Tt \\
TeI & 8 & t & e & 0 & 2 & Te \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Here, the ``common pc'' column shows the pitch class that is common to both
the inversion and the transposition pc sets. (Note that to create this chart,
the inverted form of the pc set is written in descending form rather than
ascending form, so you must read it backwards to find its normal form.) You
can make a chart like this for any pc set, and this would extremely helpful if
you were analyzing a piece of music that had this trichord present. Rather
than only looking for intervallic patterns, you could quickly refer to your
chart to identify whether a specific trichord belongs to this set class. As
you begin searching pieces for set classes, you will appreciate not having to
transpose and invert every time; it is much easier to have a complete list for
reference, and you could use our new (013) trichord ``matrix'' for this
purpose.

\hypertarget{tone-rows-serialism-and-12-tone-music}{%
\section{Tone rows, serialism, and 12-tone
music}\label{tone-rows-serialism-and-12-tone-music}}

Before we go further, we should briefly define the genre of music most
associated with set theory and matrices. (Although set theory can be used to
study \emph{any} type of music as long as it uses the twelve pitches from the
chromatic scale.) \emph{Serialism} is any music in which some aspect of the
composition is based on a pre-defined repeatable pattern; this can be the
melodic intervals, harmonic intervals, harmonies, rhythm, or any other aspect
of music that could be described in a series.

\emph{12-tone music} is a sub-genre within serialism in which a fixed series
of all twelve pitches is used to generate both the melodic and harmonic
content of the piece. There are a variety of ways in which composers have
employed this, but in its strictest form, all twelve pitches must be used
before a pitch can be repeated. The series that determines the order of all
twelve pitch classes is called a \emph{tone row}; this will always be a
listing of all twelve pitch classes with a fixed interval order. To provide
compositional variety, the tone row may be altered to any of its
transpositions or inversions, and any tone row may also be played in
\emph{retrograde} -- all pitches in reverse order. So from this, there are
four forms of a tone row. - Prime (P) - a tone row or any of its
transpositions - Retrograde (R) - any \emph{prime} row played in reverse order
- Inversion (I) - the inversion of the original prime tone row and all its
transpositions - Retrograde inversion (RI) - any inverted row played in
reverse order

Because any of these tone row orders can start on all twelve pitches, there
are forty-eight possible arrangements of any tone row: twelve prime tone rows,
twelve inverted tone rows, twelve retrograde tone rows, and 12 retrograde
inversion rows. We label these using the abbreviations P, R, I, and RI
followed by a subscript number to represent the transposition. (e.g.~P5 or
RI6).

\hypertarget{expanding-the-set}{%
\section{Expanding the set}\label{expanding-the-set}}

Now imagine that you were trying to create a visual representation for all
forty-eight tone row possibilities in the same way we did above for the (013)
trichord. You would have to create one of our charts for both the prime form
and retrograde, and each row would twenty-three pitch classes in it. Luckily,
there is a simpler, space efficient way to do this--a tone row matrix, so
let's set some ground rules. If you were to use the normal and/or prime form,
there is technically only one form for an aggregate pitch set: (0123456789te).
But for tone rows, we treat the intervallic pattern as a fixed part of the pc
set--meaning we do \emph{not} put the pc set into normal form. So you know, we
can create nearly a million different distinct combinations of all twelve
pitch classes if we fix the intervallic structure as well!

To illustrate this, try creating the first two lines of our twenty-three pitch
class chart, T0/T0I and T1/T1I, for the following pc set: T0 =
(0,e,6,7,t,9,4,3,5,8,1,2)

Start by writing T0, and then write the inversion backwards from the first
number. Then do the same for, T1.

\hypertarget{conclusion-24}{%
\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-24}}

The answer to the pc set would take up too much screen for me to succinctly
write in a table here, but I've written it in plain text. (Remember that the
inverted row must be read from the center note, the bolded note, moving
backward.) - T0I t e 4 7 9 8 3 2 5 6 1 \textbf{0} e 6 7 t 9 4 3 5 8 1 2 T0 -
T1I e 0 5 8 t 9 4 3 6 7 2 \textbf{1} 0 7 8 e t 5 4 6 9 2 3 T1

What do you notice as you work through this? Can you think of a different way
to visually represent this rather than just mirroring T1? While the trichord's
chart above was not too unwiedly for addressing all possible variations, can
you think of a way to create a chart that shows every combination (transposed
and inverted) of a tone row that would take less space than the clunky chart
above?

\hypertarget{developing-a-matrix}{%
\section{Developing a matrix}\label{developing-a-matrix}}

What if rather than writing T0 and T0I in a straight line, we rotated the
inversion pc set, T0I, downward at 90 degree angle to create a vertical
column? This would create the outline for a 12 by 12 grid with T0 as the top
row and T0I as the first column.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lllllllllllll@{}}
\toprule
-- & T0I & & & & & & & & & & & \\
\midrule
\endhead
T0 & 0 & e & 6 & 7 & t & 9 & 4 & 3 & 5 & 8 & 1 & 2 \\
-- & 1 & & & & & & & & & & & \\
-- & 6 & & & & & & & & & & & \\

-- & 4 & & & & & & & & & & & \\
-- & e & & & & & & & & & & & \\
-- & t & & & & & & & & & & & \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

This grid is a called a \emph{matrix}. We could then fill in each \emph{row}
of our matrix with the transpositions of the original pc set and each column
with inversions. For example, where would the other two pc sets that we
figured out in our original example, T1 and T1I, fit in this grid?

\hypertarget{filling-out-the-matrix}{%
\section{Filling out the matrix}\label{filling-out-the-matrix}}

Because the top row is the original, prime version of this pc set and the
column is its inversion, it makes sense to place the next pc sets, T1 and T1I,
in the row and column respectively that begin with the pitch class ``1.'' It
would look like this:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lllllllllllll@{}}
\toprule
-- & T0I & & & & & & & & & & T1I & \\
\midrule
\endhead
T0 & 0 & e & 6 & 7 & t & 9 & 4 & 3 & 5 & 8 & 1 & 2 \\
T1 & 1 & 0 & 7 & 8 & e & t & 5 & 4 & 6 & 9 & 2 & 3 \\

-- & e & & & & & & & & & & 0 & \\
-- & t & & & & & & & & & & e & \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Because of the intervallic relationships in a tone row, you'll notice the
pitch classes T1 and T1I fit perfectly with the pitch classes in the old
columns.

The great thing about this system is that once each of the transpositions
(rows) are filled in correctly, each \emph{column} will be a correctly
transposed version of the inverted tone rows. Once filled in, a matrix such as
this shows every transposition and inversion of any tone row.

Using our terminology of P, R, I, and RI, complete the tone row matrix above
by filling in each row and then labeling. Is it necessary to go in a
particular order? What is the easiest way to fill it out for you? Knowing that
we use P, I, R, and RI to label each direction of the matrix, how would you
differentiate each tone row? Would retrograde tone rows be labeled by their
starting pitch or their corresponding prime label?

\hypertarget{properties-of-the-matrix}{%
\section{Properties of the matrix}\label{properties-of-the-matrix}}

Finally let's touch on some general important concepts and common mistakes
that you will encounter when creating tone row matrices.

\hypertarget{important-concepts-1}{%
\subsection{Important concepts}\label{important-concepts-1}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The most often used labeling method for tone row matrices is fixed-zero
  notation, but movable-zero is preferred by some. Either is possible, but
  make sure that you are consistent in your application and clearly state
  which method you are using in any analysis.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In fixed-zero, 0 will always be the pitch class that includes C.
  \item
    In movable-zero, the analyst chooses a primary pitch to designate as 0
    based on the important features of the piece (e.g.~it is often the first
    pitch class of the piece) and then determines each other pitch class's
    number based on the intervallic relationship to the designated 0 pitch
    class.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In a tone row matrix, label each prime and inversion tone row by the
  abbreviation \texttt{P} or \texttt{I} respectively, followed by a subscript
  integer of the first pitch class for that row.
\item
  However, label retrograde (R) and retrograde inversion (RI) rows by their
  corresponding prime (P) and inversion (I) rows. If you don't have a
  completed matrix available, but you know that a tone row is a R or RI form,
  you can just label it using the \textbf{last} pitch of the tone row, because
  that is the first pitch class of the corresponding P or I row. Therefore, R
  and RI rows are always labeled using their last pitch.
\item
  When building a matrix, there are two ways to arrange the prime and
  inversion tone rows of the matrix depending on which transposition of the
  tone row that you choose to place in the top level of the matrix.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    One possible layout prioritizes a specific iteration of the tone row by
    placing it in the top row of the matrix \emph{in its non-transposed
    iteration}. Typically, your original tone row will be taken from a piece
    of music, so many theorists prefer to format the original row in the top
    position of the matrix. You must then determine each prime row based on
    this original row.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      For example, if the first iteration of the row started on A-flat, the
      first row in the matrix would be that row. If you are using fixed-zero
      notation this would be labeled P8, but if you are using movable-zero,
      this would be labeled P0.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    On the other hand, a matrix is meant to be a useful tool for composers and
    analysts, so it's primary role is to help you track all possible uses of
    the row. It is easier to create a matrix that starts on 0, because
    creating the first inverted row (I0) can be created using your standard
    fixed-zero inversions. (i.e.~0 becomes 0, 1 becomes e, 2 becomes t, etc.)
    If using fixed-zero, though, it is rare that the piece will begin on pitch
    class 0 (C). Instead, you can simply transpose your entire tone row to
    start on 0, write this as the top left row of your matrix, and then create
    the matrix as we did above. Even though your rows will be in a different
    order, every row will be \emph{labeled} identically to the other method
    because you are using fixed-zero notation.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      For example, if the first iteration of the row started on A-flat (pc 8
      in fixed-zero), you would subtract 8 (or add 4) to transpose the entire
      row to begin on pitch class 0. You can then place this as the top row of
      your matrix and build the matrix normally. All rows will be labeled
      correctly according to fixed-zero notation. To make sure that you
      remember which row is the original row, you will probably want to mark
      it in some way. I do this by circling the row label (e.g.~P8) of the row
      that begins the piece.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  When done correctly, any tone row matrix will have a pitch class that
  extends diagonally from the top left cell of the matrix to the bottom right
  cell. In the correct chart above, you can see that the pitch class 0 is in
  the first cell and then connects diagonally across the entire matrix.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{common-mistakes}{%
\subsection{Common mistakes}\label{common-mistakes}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The most common mistake when creating a matrix, other than simply
  mis-transposing, is the mislabeling of the tone rows. Remember that the
  labels for R and RI rows are based on their corresponding prime and inverted
  rows, NOT the starting pitch of the R or RI rows.
\item
  When using a matrix to analyze a 12-tone piece of music, you will
  occasionally encounter tone row \emph{elision}. Two rows are said to be
  elighted if the ending pitch class(es) of of one row are actually shared to
  become the beginning pitch class(es) of the next row. If you encounter a
  tone row that seems to have less than twelve pitch classes, this is likely
  the reason.
\item
  If you use movable-zero, you will need to be careful in creating your first
  inverted row because you will not be inverting around C=0. Proponents of
  this method usually suggest inverting interval by interval away from the
  first pitch class. (e.g.~If the first interval of the row is an
  \emph{ascending} M3, then the first interval of your inverted row will be a
  \emph{descending} M3. You will continue this process for each interval.)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{technology-is-greatto-a-point}{%
\section{Technology is great\ldots to a
point}\label{technology-is-greatto-a-point}}

As with most things, some enterprising people have created a shortcut to all
of this work. There are now free-to-use matrix calculators such as the 12-tone
assistant at
\href{http://in.music.sc.edu/fs/bain/software/tta-v2.4d/default.htm}{this
excellent website}. These are great to speed up your analysis, but as a
student, make sure that you understand the principles of why and how these
work before becoming entirely reliant on them. Even when trying to use this
website, you must understand exactly what output you are trying to achieve
before you can choose the correct option.

Admittedly, it is unlikely that you will ever be required to create a tone row
matrix without access to a calculator (unless you are taking a music theory
exam.) But the tedium of transposing each of the rows by hand will help you
notice patterns in the tone row and help you to remember the nuances of the
tone row as you analyze. This often provides insight into the analysis that
would be missed by those relying on a calculator to create the matrix.

As discussed in the previous topics, scales represent a pitch collection,
centered around a tonic pitch. Because we can transpose these pitch
collections to center around any pitch-class, we create twelve unique pitch
centers--called \emph{keys}--and even more if we include enharmonic
equivalents. Because writing accidentals for many of these keys would be
clunky and difficult to read, we use a system of key signatures to give the
performer a simple way of knowing which pitches in the key are raised and
lowered.

\hypertarget{key-signatures}{%
\section{Key signatures}\label{key-signatures}}

Diatonic music is built around perfect intervals, although as we will see
below, introducing one non-perfect interval to a series of perfect intervals
creates the major scale and consequently diatonic tonality. Because of this
non-perfect interval, key signatures follow a very simple pattern that can be
reversed whether you are raising or lowering pitches.

\hypertarget{goals-for-this-topic-13}{%
\subsection{Goals for this topic}\label{goals-for-this-topic-13}}

In the examples below, you will find sets of three keys. Use these to find: -
the order of sharps and flats - including any mnemonic devices to remember
these - and the intervallic structure of the order of sharps and flats - what
differentiates \emph{diatonic} and \emph{chromatic} pitches - a method for
determining the \emph{relative} and \emph{parallel} minor keys from a major
key - as well as the \emph{relative} and \emph{parallel} major keys from a
minor key

\hypertarget{a-caveat}{%
\subsection{A caveat}\label{a-caveat}}

Please note that any \emph{scale} that shares a tonic note is considered to be
one key. Even though this may contradict your intuitive thoughts, this means
that G major and G minor are considered the same \textbf{key}! Instead, we
call them \emph{modes} of each other, not different keys. The explanation for
this terminology is best left for once we have more tools to examine it, but
for now, practice using the correct terminology to avoid a confusing
``re-learning'' moment later in the course.

\subsection{Keys that use sharps and the minor keys that are related to

Use these examples to determine the order of sharps. Pay particular attention
to which \textbf{scale degrees} are affected in each key as sharps are added.
Is it the same scale degree in each key? How is this related to the tonic? If
you continue the pattern, are you able to discern the name of the next key and
which accidentals are added? You should also be able to determine the
relationship between a major key and its parallel and relative minors.

\hypertarget{conclusions-67}{%
\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-67}}

In the next topic, we will discuss how the overtone series creates our
perception of pitch, tonality, and music as a whole. But for now, we can
observe that one aspect of the overtone series, the circle-of-fifths, plays a
critical role in defining diatonic function and key signatures. The order of
sharps and flats follows a series of ascending perfect 5th intervals. - Order
of sharps: F - C - G - D - A - E - B - Order of flats: B - E - A - D - G - C -
F

Note that the two orders are simply reversed sequences of each other.

\hypertarget{tips-for-finding-major-key-signatures}{%
\subsection{Tips for finding major key
signatures}\label{tips-for-finding-major-key-signatures}}

Your ultimate goal for key signatures should be the ability to instantly
recall all key signatures from memory, but there are two common tricks that
you can use to find the major key implied by any key signature.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  For any key signature with two or more flats, the name of the key is the
  \emph{second to last flat} when reading from left to right. For example, in
  a key signature with four flats, the four flats from left to right are
  B-flat, E-flat, A-flat, and D-flat. The second to last flat is A-flat, so
  A-flat major is the implied major key of this key signature.
\item
  For any sharp key signature, you can go up a half-step (minor 2nd) from the
  last sharp to find the tonic of the implied major key. For example, in a key
  signature with four sharps, the sharps are F-sharp, C-sharp, G-sharp, and
  D-sharp when read from left to right. The last sharp is D-sharp and a minor
  2nd above D-sharp is E-natural. So E major is the implied major key of this
  key signature.
\end{enumerate}

Of course, these tricks do not work for C major (no sharps or flats) or F
major (one flat), but you should be able to remember those two keys.

\hypertarget{tips-for-finding-minor-key-signatures}{%
\subsection{Tips for finding minor key
signatures}\label{tips-for-finding-minor-key-signatures}}

You can combine the two tricks above with your knowledge of relative major and
minor keys to quickly find the implied minor key of a key signature, because
relative major and minor keys \emph{share a key signature}. For example, if
you know that a key signature of four sharps implies E major, you can go to
the sixth scale degree of E major to find the tonic of the relative minor--in
this case, C\#. Therefore, E major and C-sharp minor both share a key
signature of four sharps.

In diatonic harmony, second-inversion chords do not function in the same way
as other inversions. Whereas root-position chords are stable, and first- and
third-inversion chords create momentum by placing tendency tones in the bass,
second-inversion chords are generally considered ``weaker.'' For example,
listen to the following sonority repeatedly. It contains both a P4 and P5
above the a root. Because there is a dissonance between the upper two voices,
you will likely hear this as wanting to resolve in some way. Isolate the voice
that you would like to resolve and then figure out how you are naturally
resolving it by singing it.

\{\% capture ex6 \%\}X:6 T:Perfect 4th versus perfect 5th M:4/4 L:1/2 Q:1/4=80
K:C V:1 {[}C2FG{]}\textbar{} {[}C2FG{]}\textbar{} {[}C2FG{]}\textbar{]}\{\%
endcapture \%\} \{\% include abc-example.html number=``6'' abc=ex6 \%\}

Most people will resolve this sonority as if it were a root position major
triad that has a suspended third, although some might hear this as a minor
triad instead. The P5 seems more stable as opposed to the P4. These
resolutions would sound like this:

\{\% capture ex7 \%\}X:7 T:Resolving the perfect 4th M:4/4 L:1/2 Q:1/4=80 K:C
V:1 {[}CFG{]}``major''{[}CEG{]}\textbar{}
{[}CFG{]}``minor''{[}C\_EG{]}\textbar{]}\{\% endcapture \%\} \{\% include
abc-example.html number=``7'' abc=ex7 \%\}

Conversely, if you were to hear the P4 as the more stable interval, you would
resolve the P5 upward to create a second-inversion triad in either major or
minor.

\{\% capture ex8 \%\}X:8 T:Resolving the perfect 5th M:4/4 L:1/2 Q:1/4=80 K:C
V:1 {[}CFG{]}``major''{[}CFA{]}\textbar{}
{[}CFG{]}``minor''{[}CF\_A{]}\textbar{]}\{\% endcapture \%\} \{\% include
abc-example.html number=``8'' abc=ex8 \%\}

Not only are these examples effective in demonstrating your ear's natural
inclination toward root position, but they also show the basic diatonic
underpinning of for limiting the use of second-inversion chords. In the above
example that resolved the original sonority to an F major/minor chord, you can
see how closely-related any key is to the key of its subdominant. Therefore,
if used incorrectly, second-inversion chords can destabilize your part-writing
by pushing toward a different key.

\hypertarget{tertiary-functions}{%
\section{Tertiary functions}\label{tertiary-functions}}

Because second-inversion triads are not as stable as the other inversions,
they must be used differently in your part-writing. Instead of fulfilling a
primary function such as tonic, dominant, or pre-dominant, they will have one
of the four tertiary functions, one of which we already discussed in the
previous unit: - cadential - passing - pedal - arpeggiated

For each of these functions, the chord will be extending the primary function
of another chord rather than defining its own.

\hypertarget{doubling-1}{%
\section{Doubling}\label{doubling-1}}

As a general rule, 6/4 chords function best when the bass voice is doubled. As
you harmonize the chords in each of the examples below, notice how often this

\section{Cadential 6/4s}\label{cadential-64s}}

A cadential 6/4 chord is the most straightforward usage of second inversion
chord, because it has the most specific rules. - It occurs when a I6/4 chord
precedes a \emph{root-position} V or V7 chord. - It cannot move to an
inversion of a V chord or any version of a viio chord. - The I6/4 loses its
tonic function and instead acts as an extension of the dominant function. -
Some consider this chord a suspension of some of the chord tones of the
dominant chord. - It always occurs as part of the cadence for a phrase, hence
the name.

Harmonize the following three examples to see how well the voice-leading works
for a cadential 6/4 chord.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-68}}

Cadential 6/4 progressions are often used to correct part-writing errors in
approaching the V chord. Look at the third progression that you just
harmonized. If the cadential 6/4 were removed, it would create parallel
perfect 5ths between the soprano and bass.

Some theory methods teach that a cadential 6/4 should not be labeled as a
I6/4; instead, they label it as a V6/4 - 5/3. The reasoning behind this is
twofold: - The I chord does not have a tonic function. - The cadential 6/4
chord resembles a 4-3 suspension and a 6-5 suspension occurring at the same
time. These reasons ensure that students understand the true function of the
cadential 6/4.

I prefer to label it as a I6/4 chord, however, because: - We do not create
special usage cases in our Roman numeral system for any other chord. It
creates an unnecessary exception for students to learn and often confuses
students. - By having two different chords labeled as a V6/4, it is easy for
students to confuse a cadential 6/4 with an actual V6/4, a chord that occurs
regularly as a passing chord. (Read more on this below under the \emph{passing
6/4} section.) - When looking at an analysis, we are required to understand
that almost every 6/4 chord has a tertiary function (i.e.~passing, cadential,
passing, and arpeggiated), but we do not create special Roman numeral cases
for the other three types of tertiary functions. Students are more than
capable of learning the other three usages of second inversion chords, and
they can remember that a I6/4 followed by a root-position V or V7 chord is a
cadential 6/4 and has a dominant function.

As with all tertiary function chords, it is helpful to label a chord when it
is not functioning as a primary function. For example, if a strange chord is
functioning as a passing chord, we do not simply label it with a Roman
numeral, because a Roman numeral without an explanation assumes that the chord
is functioning in its primary role. For tertiary functions, it is helpful to
note somewhere in the analysis that it is functioning as a passing chord. It
is helpful to apply the same strategy for cadential 6/4 chords, so I recommend
bracketing the I6/4 and V chord together and putting an abbreviated ``cad''
below the bracket.

\hypertarget{passing-64s}{%
\section{Passing 6/4s}\label{passing-64s}}

Passing chords are the second alternate function for second-inversion chords,
and they function identically to our description of how
\href{11-further-part-writing/b1-voiceleading1stand3rdinv.html}{first- and
third-inversion chords are used as passing chords}--a chord inserted between
two other chords to create a bass line with stepwise motion. As before,
\emph{passing} is a function that replaces a chord's primary function, and
instead extends the function of the chords on either side. Harmonize the
following example of a passing 6/4.

\hypertarget{conclusions-69}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-69}}

Understanding that the ii chord in this example acts as a passing chord rather
than a pre-dominant chord also explains how a V chord moves convincingly to a
ii chord. When a chord resolves against the normal flow of a circle-of-fifths
flowchart (see \href{07-harmonic-functions/a1-diaprogcirclefifths.html}{Unit
7a}), we call that a \emph{regression}. In the example above, the first V
chord \emph{should} resolve to a tonic chord but instead regresses to a ii
chord. This works because of the strength of the bass line, so it is the
\emph{passing function} that extends the dominant harmony through a stepwise
bass line.**

\hypertarget{function-over-form-part-4}{%
\section{Function over form (Part 4)}\label{function-over-form-part-4}}

Now that we have practiced using a passing 6/4 chord, we can also clarify why
viio6 chords function well as a passing chord. When studying first inversion
chords {[}Unit
11b{]}{]}(11-further-part-writing/b1-voiceleading1stand3rdinv.html), we
discussed two important ideas regarding viio chords: - The viio is a
functional substitution for the V7 chord and therefore takes its voice-leading
and doubling conventions from the V7 chord. - The viio6 is often employed as a
passing chord between I and I6 to create a bass line with stepwise motion.

This explains why a viio6 chord functions as a passing chord; it is actually a
functional substitution for a passing V6/4 chord. Harmonize the following two
progressions to see how similar these two chords are.

\hypertarget{pedal}{%
\section{Pedal}\label{pedal}}

Like the cadential 6/4 and passing 6/4 chords, the pedal 6/4 is defined by the
motion that it creates within a voice--most often the bass line. A pedal 6/4
occurs when a voice remains static across multiple chords by employing a
second inversion chord. \emph{Note that this is different from a non-chord
tone pedal}, because a pedal 6/4 chord uses only chord tones to create the
static pedal; it does not use non-chord tones to create the pedal. Harmonize
the following two examples of common pedal 6/4 chords.

\hypertarget{arpeggiated}{%
\section{Arpeggiated}\label{arpeggiated}}

The fourth and final acceptable usage of 6/4 chords occurs when the bass line
arpeggiates through a chord. When part-writing arpeggiated chords, you will
not have stepwise motion unless you use non-chord tones, because the chord
tones will either remain static or skip between chord tones. Try the following
example, and you will see how this requires voices to jump between chord
tones.

\hypertarget{conclusions-70}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-70}}

The most common question regarding arpeggiated chords is how to handle them in
your analyses. Depending on the harmonic rhythm of the piece, an arpeggiated
chord may be viewed as either a melodic bass line that does not change
inversion or an entirely new instance of the chord in a different inversion.

Your decision should ultimately reflect how you hear the piece. If you have a
repeated harmony but each reiteration of the harmony sounds like a new phrase
or statement, then you should label each inversion of the chord according to
its bass note. On the other hand, if it sounds like one continuous harmony,
particularly if a melody and phrasing implies this, then you do not need to
mark every inversion of the chord.

Regardless, you should label the chord's inversion by the \emph{strongest}
note in the bass. This will often be the lowest note in the arpeggiation, but
your perception can shift depending on the order in which you hear the
arpeggiation as well as which pitches are in the strongest metric position.
Take time to listen to the passage carefully, and choose the pitch that most
closely reflects your perception.

\textbf{Frequency Ratio}

-1:2 is the most basic ratio we can create with two frequencies. 1:2 creates
an octave difference.

-When we have two waves (frequencies) that line up evey two waves (in the
crest), our ear hears that repetition as a pitch but one is higher than the
other.

-The next simplist ratio is 2:3. This creates a P5 sound.

\textbf{P5} When we stack the first five P5 around the circle, we get a major
pentatonic scale. When F\# is changed is changed after B (instead of F), the
cycle only repeats after seven pitches instead of all twelve.

\textbf{What is a key signature?} - A set of sharps or flats defining the
scale that you're playing in? - Close: the wording implies a key signature
where sharps and flats occur together, which isn't the standard key signature
we're trying to come up with a definition for

\textbf{What is a key?} - A pattern that results in a tonal center? - Yes,
though the ``tonal center'' part is what we are especially concerned with!

\textbf{For diatonic purposes:} - Key is defined by a tonic - Key signature
acts as a shorthand in reference to the notes organized \emph{around} the
tonic (like a legend on a map)

\textbf{Tricks (other than memorization) for figuring out what key signature
you're in} - Sharps: last sharp + up a half step = the key - Flats: second to
last flat = the name of the key

When you're writing in a single key for an extended period of time, it gets
tedious to write out the accidentals over and over again.

Here is a simple melody in D major, without a key signature.

To avoid this, composers used \emph{key signatures} at the beginning of each
staff to remind performers of which pitch classes should have flats or sharps.

Here is the same melody, with the key signature at the beginning of the staff
to remind the performer that F and C should be sharp.

\hypertarget{the-circle-of-fifths}{%
\subsection{The circle of fifths}\label{the-circle-of-fifths}}

The circle of fifths is an illustration that has been used in music theory
pedagogy for hundreds of years. It conveniently summarizes the key signature
needed for any key with up to seven flats or sharps.

But \emph{which} notes are flat or sharp in a key? To properly use the circle
of fifths to figure out a key signature, you'll need to also remember this
mnemonic device, which tells you the order of flats and sharps:

\textbf{F}ather \textbf{C}harles \textbf{G}oes \textbf{D}own \textbf{A}nd
\textbf{E}nds \textbf{B}attle.

For sharp keys (clockwise on the circle of fifths), read the mnemonic device
forward. For example, the circle of fifths tells us that there are 3 sharps in
the key of A major. Which three notes are sharp? The first three notes in the
mnemonic device: F(ather), C(harles), and G(oes).

For flat keys (counter-clockwise on the circle of fifths), read the mnemonic
device backwards. For example, the circle of fifths tells us that the key of
A-flat major has four flats. Which flats? Reading backwards: B(attle), E(nds),
A(nd), D(own).

\hypertarget{minor-key-signatures}{%
\subsection{Minor key signatures}\label{minor-key-signatures}}

Of course, minor keys can use key signatures, too. In fact, for each major key
signature, there is a corresponding minor key that shares its signature. Major
and minor keys that share the same key signature are called \emph{relative}
keys. For example, both C major and A minor have zero sharps or flats. A minor
is considered the \emph{relative minor} of C major; likewise, C major is
considered the \emph{relative major} of A minor. Compare the minor key circle
of fifths below with the major key circle of fifths above, and you'll see the
remaining relative key pairs.

\textbf{What is serialism?} - Using set rules/creating your own rules to
follow in order to systematically compose a piece of music

\textbf{Using the transposition/inversion system we've used so far, it becomes
clear that there are 24 total vesion of any default pitch class set. How do we
represent this information in a streamlined, easily interpreted format?} - Put
it in a matrix! See examples in the textbook. - Matrices can have any number
of pitches in their pitch class sets, but we will deal most with 12-tone
music, where a matrix is made up of a tone row with all 12 pitches

\textbf{12-tone music} - Prime (P): a tone row or any of its transpositions -
Retrograde (R): any prime row played in reverse order - Inversion (I): the
inversion of the original prime tone row and all its inversions - Retrograde
Inversion (RI): any inverted row played in reverse order - When you make a
matrix, these four groups will be easily labeled and organized! It ends up
looking like a big square.

\textbf{Developing a matrix} - When we construct a matrix, we write the
original row across the top (horizontally) and its inversion down the side
(vertically). This only works when your row begins with 0 (since 0's inversion
is 0), so if you start your row with a first number other than 0, zero it out
and use that one for your top row instead - Once you have these two, you can
transpose for each horizontal line going off of the first digits provided in
the inversion/first veritcal column. The lines represent transpositions, and
the columns are inversions - You can check yourself by making sure that you
have 0's in a diagonal across the middle from the upper left corner to the
bottom right corner - The subscript numbers will always match for P/R and
I/RI. Retrograde and retrograde inversion labels \emph{must} match the prime
and inversion labels so that we know what they are a retrograde \emph{of}. So,
R and RI rows will have subscripts that don't match the number they start
with.

The primary purpose for a tone row matrix is to use it as a point of reference
to analyze 12-tone music. It gives us a list of all the possible rows a
composer might use in their piece.

You can have a tone row with less than 12 tones, but our matrix method only
works with a full 12-tone row. So don't use it for hexachords and stuff

Secondary Functions: replace the primary functions Tertiary chords: take on
the function of those around them by extending/embellishing; they work in
chromatic and diatonic harmony

If you see a I6/4, it is most likely functioning as something other than the
tonic.

\textbf{There are four types of second inversion chords:} - Cadential -
Passing - Pedal - Arpeggiated

Second inversion triads have to be tertiary function.

\textbf{Doubling rules:} - Double the bass! In this case, that would be the
fifth of the chord. Doubling the root is possible, but more difficult than
doubling the fifth

\textbf{Cadential 6/4 chords} - I6/4 will ALWAYS come before V(7). V(7) must
be in root position because the bass movement must be static between the two
chords. I6/4 - V(7) - I gives us a very smooth soprano line, but in order to
do that there needs to be a common tone in the bass at some point - I6/4 has
dominant function because it extends V(7) - Label it using a bracket to show
dominant function:

\textbf{Passing 6/4 chords} - I - V - ii6/4 - V6 - I - Whenever you have a
passing chord, its ``primary function'' becomes that of the chords around it,
no matter was Roman numeral it is. In this example, ii6/4 has a dominant
function because it acts as part of the V's around it - Their tertiary
function is basically just to act as a bridge between other chords--to make
voice leading easier. We wouldn't have been able to set up our cool
contrasting motion soprano and bass in this example without the passing 6/4 in
the middle

You have likely heard the terms \emph{overtone series} and \emph{harmonic
series} while discussing music, but unless you have studied them previously,
you may not realize the importance of this concept in creating tonality. The
overtone series occurs naturally in all non-synthetic tone production. When a
person sings, a harmonic series is present above every pitch. When any
woodwind, string, or brass instrument creates a pitch, a harmonic series is
present above every pitch. Perhaps even more importantly for our discussions,
we can study the acoustics--or the math--behind this overtone series to
explain the fundamentals of Western harmony.

The overtone series can help you to understand: - why we divide the octave
into twelve parts. - why we hear some intervals as consonant and others as
dissonant. - how we determine if an interval is in tune. - why we use a
harmonic system based on perfect intervals and thirds.

\hypertarget{the-structure-of-the-overtone-series}{%
\section{The Structure of the Overtone
Series}\label{the-structure-of-the-overtone-series}}

The overtone series is a series of intervals, or a \emph{harmonic series},
above a given pitch. We call the lowest pitch the \emph{fundamental}, and
every tone above it is considered an \emph{overtone}. In the example below,
\texttt{C2} is the fundamental, \texttt{C3} is the first overtone, \texttt{G3}
is the second overtone, and so on.

You may also describe the tones of the overtone series by labeling each
overtone as a \emph{partial}. In this system, the fundamental is considered
equal to all other tones, so it is labeled as the first partial. In the
example below, \texttt{C2} is the first partial, \texttt{C3} is the second
partial, \texttt{G3} is the third partial, and so on.

For the example below, determine the numbering for each of these notes as both
overtones and partials. Then practice transposing the entire series to other
pitches.

mind that each evolutionary step he discusses adds another partial from the
overtone series.

\hypertarget{the-physics-of-music}{%
\subsection{The Physics of Music}\label{the-physics-of-music}}

The division of the octave into twelve parts is our brains' interpretations of
a simple mathematical phenomenon. When the frequency of a soundwave doubles,
our brains hear those two frequencies as sharing some fundamental commonality,
so it interprets those two pitches as the ``same'' but separated by an octave.
Therefore, octaves always have a 2:1 ratio. (A110, A220, A440, and A880 are
all \texttt{A} separated by octaves.) The next two simplest ratios ares a 3:2
ratio and a 4:3 ratio, which create a perfect 5th and a perfect 4th
respectively.

The importance of these ratios is most easily observed in the circle of
fifths. If you begin on any pitch-class and begin moving by ascending perfect
5ths (or 4ths), you will find yourself back at the beginning after cycling
through all twelve pitch-classes. We call this the circle of fifths.

C - G - D - A - E - B - F-sharp - C-sharp - G-sharp - D-sharp/E-flat - B-flat
- F - \emph{C}

Perhaps more important for our discussion, though, is what happens when we
introduce a diminished 5th into the pattern. Try this quick exercise: 1.
Choose any starting pitch, and then write your starting pitch and the next six
pitches from the circle of fifths on a separate piece of paper. - If you've
done this correctly, you should have one pitch for every letter name. e.g.~one
`A,' one `B,' etc. 2. Choose any pitch within your seven pitches, and lower it
by one half-step thus creating the interval of a diminished 5th between it and
the previous pitch. 3. We will consider the two pitches of this diminished 5th
to be our starting interval. Starting with the first pitch after your
interval, begin altering the pitches to create perfect 5ths based on your
altered note. - For example, if you chose to alter A to A-flat, you would have
created a diminished 5th between D and A-flat. You will then lower all pitches
after A-flat to create perfect 5ths again, starting by lowering E to E-flat.
4. Continue lowering pitches (and creating perfect 5ths) through the circle of
fifths until you wrap around to your original interval. - If you started by
altering A, you created a diminished 5th between D and A-flat. You will then
lower every pitch until you get back to D, but leave D unaltered. In this
example, you would end with: D - \emph{A-flat} - E-flat - B-flat - F - C - G
5. If you re-arrange the seven pitches that you've created, you will notice
that you have created a diatonic collection of seven pitches. - Continuing our
example that we started by altering A to A-flat, you can see that we have
three flat notes, and if you use your knowledge of key signatures, you know
that the major scale with three flats starts on the tonic of E-flat. If you
re-arrange these pitches, you will see: E-flat - F - G - A-flat - B-flat - C -
D

This slight change--the addition of one diminished 5th--creates the necessary
tension for keys to function diatonically, so diatonic function could be
described as a slight imperfection on an otherwise perfect series of
intervals.

This can be further shown by looking at the naturally occuring intervals if we
write diatonic 5ths above the notes of a major scale.

Because we explored harmonic function in Unit 6, the tension provided by the
one non-perfect 5th and its subsequent release should now be obvious.

Key signatures reflect the importance of the one non-perfect interval. When
studying the consecutive key signatures, you should focus on \emph{which scale
degree} is changed between consecutive keys. - When a sharp is added to a key,
it always raises the 7th scale degree in the new key, thereby creating the new
\texttt{ti}. - When a flat is added to a key, it always lowers the 4th scale
degree in the new key, thereby creating the new \texttt{fa}.

\hypertarget{order-of-sharps-and-flats}{%
\subsection{Order of sharps and flats}\label{order-of-sharps-and-flats}}

This directly reflects how diatonic function works; if we change \emph{where}
the one non-perfect 5th occurs, we change the key. We did not need to spend
time determining the order of sharps and flats, because the class was already
familiar with this from previous courses. It did not surprise them that
circle-of-fifths plays a critical role in defining diatonic function and key
signatures. The two orders are simply the reverses of each other. - Order of
sharps: F - C - G - D - A - E - B - Order of flats: B - E - A - D - G - C - F

\hypertarget{conclusions-71}{%
\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-71}}

The \emph{overtone series}, often referred to as the \emph{harmonic series},
is a series of intervals built off of a pitch. There are two ways to label the
overtone series. - Label the the first pitch of an overtone series the
\textbf{fundamental} and every pitch above it is then numbered as an
\textbf{overtone}. - Fundamental, 1st overtone, 2nd overtone, etc. - Label
each pitch as a numbered \textbf{partial}. - 1st partial, 2nd partial, 3rd
partial, etc.

The overtone series occurs naturally and can be explained mathematically, so
it is one of the few objective ways in which we can discuss the origin of
music. Any interval can be viewed as a ratio comparing the frequncies of the
two pitches that create the interval. The simplest ratio, other than 1:1, is
2:1. For example, \texttt{C2} has a frequency of about 65.4 hertz (hz =
vibrations per second), and \texttt{C3} has a frequency of about 130.8: a
ratio of 2:1. When we hear two frequencies that have a 2:1 ratio, our brains
interpret this as ``the same pitch separated by an octave'' -- an elegant
solution to interpreting a physical phenomenon. This example demonstrates that
all concepts associated with music, such as pitches, dividing octaves,
intonation, etc., are human creations trying to organize and interpret the
physical phenomenon of soundwaves entering our ear.

The overtone series orders intervals by decreasing size but increasing
complexity. The first interval of the overtone series, a P8, is the
``simplest'' interval of 2:1. As the overtone series moves upward, each
interval becomes smaller but more complex. A P5 has a ratio of 3:2, a P4 has a
ratio of 4:3, a M3 has a ratio of 5:4, and onward.

\hypertarget{concepts-derived-from-the-overtone-series}{%
\section{Concepts derived from the overtone
series}\label{concepts-derived-from-the-overtone-series}}

The overtone series is notable because: - The overtone series is present above
every note played by a standard musical instrument or the human voice. - When
a person sings a pitch, we hear the fundamental as the pitch name, but the
strength of each overtone above that fundamental determines many qualities
that we associate with the pitch such as timbre. - The overtone series is the
basis for intonation. - Using the ratios from the overtone series, we can
determine what is ``in tune.'' For example, an octave is a frequency that is
exactly twice as high as the given pitch, and a true P5 is a frequency that is
1.5 times higher than the given pitch. - Fixed pitch instruments (e.g.~piano)
use a system of \emph{equal temperament} to play in all twelve keys without
having to re-tune the instrument every time the key changes. This means that
we intentionally tune these instruments ``out of tune'' when compared to the
overtone series ratios, because being always slightly out-of-tune is a far
better compromise than being perfectly in-tune sometimes and grossly
out-of-tune at others. - The overtone series defines why the octave is divided
into 12 parts, because it is from the overtone series that we derive the
circle-of-fifths. Please refer to the discussion of the circle-of-fifths and
tonality in Lesson 2c. - The overtone series provides a visual example of why
we find certain intervals more consonant or dissonant. - We hear simpler
ratios of intervals as consonant and complex ratios as dissonant. So intervals
at the beginning of the overtone series represent consonant intervals, but as
the intervals decrease in size as the overtone series moves upward, the ratios
become more complex and therefore more dissonant. - The overtone series
provides a good foundation for voicing chords. - Idealized voicing for chords
often mimic the overtone series by placing each voice along the overtone
series of the lowest voice.

\hypertarget{remembering-the-overtone-series}{%
\subsection{Remembering the overtone
series}\label{remembering-the-overtone-series}}

There are many ways to remember the overtone series. - The first is to
remember the intervals. This is easy at the beginning of the series, but
becomes repetitive and easy to mess up as the series ascends. -
P8-P5-P4-M3-m3-m3-M2-M2-M2-M2-m2. - You can also think of them as a sequence
of scale degrees above the fundamental. - 1 - 1 - 5 - 1 - 3 - 5 - b7 - 1 - 2 -
3 - \#4 - 5 - And for some, it is easier to divide the series into groupings.
For example, when looking at the first 12 partials - The first four pitches
are a tripled fundamental and one fifth. - The second set of four pitches is a
first inversion dominant triad built off of the fundamental. - The final three
pitches represent \texttt{re-mi-fi-sol} or the beginning of the Lydian mode of
the fundamental.

When looking at this final method for remembering the first 12 pitches of the
overtone series, I find it fascinating that each group of four pitches implies
a different key area: - The first four pitches strongly imply a key that uses
the fundamental as tonic. - The next 4 partials imply a key with a tonic based
on the \emph{subdominant} of the fundamental, because the dominant seventh
chord would be a V chord in the key of the subdominant. - The third set of
four paritals imply a key with a tonic based on the \emph{dominant} of the
fundamental as demonstrated by thinking of this pattern as
\texttt{sol-la-ti-do} in the key of the dominant.

\hypertarget{from-end-of-key-signature-topic}{%
\subsection{FROM END OF KEY SIGNATURE
TOPIC}\label{from-end-of-key-signature-topic}}

\textbf{INCORPORATE INTO MATERIAL ABOVE now that we've moved this out of its
own unit}

The division of the octave into twelve parts is our brains' interpretations of
a simple mathematical phenomenon. When the frequency of a soundwave doubles,
our brains hear those two frequencies as sharing some fundamental commonality,
so it interprets those two pitches as the ``same'' but separated by an octave.
Therefore, octaves always have a 2:1 ratio. (A110, A220, A440, and A880 are
all \texttt{A} separated by octaves.) The next two simplest ratios are a 3:2
ratio and a 4:3 ratio, which create a perfect 5th and a perfect 4th
respectively.

Not only does your brain's interpretation of these ratios create the ideas of
consonance and dissonance, it is also the reason we divide the octave into
twelve instead of a ``simpler'' number such as ten. You can observe this
effect most easily in the circle of fifths. If you begin on any pitch-class
and begin moving by ascending perfect 5ths (or 4ths), you will find yourself
back at the beginning after cycling through all twelve pitch-classes. We call
this the circle of fifths.

C - G - D - A - E - B - F-sharp - C-sharp - G-sharp - D-sharp/E-flat - B-flat
- F - \emph{C}

Perhaps more important for our discussion, though, is what happens when we
introduce a non-perfect 5th into the pattern. If we begin on a pitch-class and
begin moving through ascending perfect 5ths, each new perfect 5th will move us
to a \emph{new letter}. After the first six letters, we begin adding
accidentals and then repeating letters as seen in the circle of fifths above.
If, however, we alter the last perfect 5th by a half-step to create a
diminished 5th, we can break the pattern and shortcut to the end with one
final perfect 5th.

C (P5) G (P5) D (P5) A (P5) E (P5) B (d5) \emph{F} (P5) C

This slight change creates the necessary tension for keys to function
diatonically, so diatonic function could be described as a slight imperfection
on an otherwise perfect series of intervals.

This can be further shown by looking at the naturally occurring intervals when
we write diatonic 5ths above the notes of a major scale.

\{\% capture ex7 \%\}X:7 \%\%staffsep 100\% T:Diatonic 5ths in the Major Scale
M:C L:1/2 K:C {[}CG{]} {[}DA{]}\textbar{} {[}EB{]} {[}Fc{]}\textbar{} {[}Gd{]}
{[}Ae{]}\textbar{} {[}Bf{]} {[}cg{]}\textbar\textbar{} w:P5 P5 P5 P5 P5 P5 d5
P5\{\% endcapture \%\} \{\% include abc-example.html number=``7'' abc=ex7 \%\}

When we begin exploring harmonic function in Unit 6, the tension provided by
the one non-perfect 5th and its subsequent release will become obvious.

Key signatures reflect the importance of the one non-perfect interval. When
studying the consecutive key signatures, you should focus on \emph{which scale
degree} is changed between consecutive keys. This will likely lead to two
basic principles: - When a sharp is added to a key, it always raises the 7th
scale degree in the new key, thereby creating the new \texttt{ti}. - You can
find the new \texttt{do} by going up a half-step from the new \texttt{ti}. -
When a flat is added to a key, it always lowers the 4th scale degree in the
new key, thereby creating the new \texttt{fa}. - You can find the new
\texttt{do} by going down a P4 (or up a P5) from the new \texttt{fa}.

\hypertarget{order-of-sharps-and-flats-1}{%
\subsection{Order of sharps and flats}\label{order-of-sharps-and-flats-1}}

This directly reflects how diatonic function works; if we change \emph{where}
the one non-perfect 5th occurs, we change the key. From this we can determine
a permanent order of flats or sharps, which cycles to the beginning if you
need to continue raising or lowering pitches.

\textbf{Two different systems for labeling the overtone series, either one is
good} - Fundamental + x overtone. Ex: in C, the Bb in the treble clef staff is
the sixth overtone. - Partials, which do not differentiate between the
fundamental and the other overtones. Ex: in C, the Bb in the treble clef staff
is the seventh partial.

\textbf{Methods for memorizing how to write out an overtone series} - 854-3332
+ Lydian scale to the fifth - This method requires you to remember the quality
of the intervals in the ``phone number,'' and also that the ``scale'' includes
the last note of the phone number as do - Can think of it as tonic,
subdominant, dominant - Working in C, the first 4 notes suggest C, the next 4
suggest the dominant of F (C's subdominant), and the last 4 are sol la ti do
in G (C's dominant)

Timbre = how your brain interprets the overtone series

A ``big'' sound (the kind we usually hear in professional musicians) just
means that there's a strong fundamental and a LOT of overtones in that
person's sound.

\textbf{If the overtone series exists everywhere, how did different systems of
music evolve?} - In the case of gamelan and some types of Indian music, these
systems were based off of the instruments constructed to play that music, not
the voice

How do you decide normal form with a semetrical chord? - they are all normal
form, but in reference to music, whichever occurence is more common is normal
form

\hypertarget{ascending-order-vs.-normal-form}{%
\section{Ascending Order vs.~Normal
Form}\label{ascending-order-vs.-normal-form}}

The order a PC set goes through is: 1. Unorder - (e,6,0) 2. Ascending order -
(e,0,6), (0,6,e), (6,e,0) 3. Normal form - (6,e,0) - this is normal form
because the distance between the two outer intergers is smaller than the other
ascending orders. 4. Prime form - (056) - you take normal form and orient the
intervals on zero. - even though we have a new set of numbers, the intervals
between each interger is the same.

Ascending order is not normal form, but normal form occurs in ascending order.
Ascending order takes the unordered PC set and puts it in a number of orders,
one of which is normal form. Normal form is a PC set in ascending order with
the notes as close together as possible. - one way to find normal form is to
find the smallest interval between intervals. - this is after you have found
the ascending orders that are our options for normal form.

With ascending order, you have different options to order a PC set into, like
inversions in tonal harmony.

\subsubsection{Allen Forte}\label{allen-forte}}

Allen Forte created a numbering system for each kind of PC set. - cardinality:
the number of pitch classes in a PC set. The cardinality is how Forte labels
PC sets x-x. For example, 5-1, like (0,4,7), is a major triad. - the problem
with refurring to this system is unlike (0,4,7), writing 5-1 gives you no
information about what kind of chord you have unless you look up the Forte
table.

\textbf{The reason we use numbers is to represent all enharmonic equivilants
and narrow the idea down to how it exists sonically: as 1 note. 1 note gets 1
number.}

How many possible combinations of (015) are there? - this includes any PC set
that shares the same intervals, or the inversion and its shared intervals -
this gives us 24 combinations.

Ex: (015) - could be {[}1,2,6{]}, {[}2,3,7{]}, {[}3,4,8{]}, {[}4,5,9{]}
etc\ldots{} - inversion: (0,e,7), normal form {[}7,e,0{]} - could be
{[}8,0,1{]}, {[}9,1,2{]}, {[}t,2,3{]} etc\ldots{}
