<p><strong>As you read the following excerpt from Kris Shaffer’s <em>Open Music Theory</em>, try to find the value in developing a basic understanding of counterpoint in a tonal harmony–two very different styles of composition. We will only discuss strict counterpoint briefly, but it can provide a good deal of insight into our studies.</strong></p><h2 id="class-reading-from-open-music-theory">Class reading from <em>Open Music Theory</em></h2><p>The study of the theory of Western music involves three main components: voice-leading, harmony, and form. <em>Voice-leading</em> deals with the relationship of two or more musical lines (or melodies) combined into a single musical idea. <em>Harmony</em> addresses the rules or norms for combining chords into successions. <em>Form</em> addresses the rules or norms for the combination of phrases and other small musical units into larger units—including whole movements and works.</p><p>We will address all three of these facets of musical theory. However, of the three, voice-leading is the most fundamental. Thus, we begin our study of music theory, then, with <em>strict voice-leading</em>, or <em>counterpoint</em>.</p><p>Twentieth-century musician and theorist, Heinrich Schenker, wrote:</p><blockquote><p>The purpose of counterpoint, rather than to teach a specific style of composition, is to lead the ear of the serious student of music for the first time into the infinite world of fundamental musical problems (<em>Kontrapunkt</em>, p. 10).</p></blockquote><p>Following this line of thinking, our early voice-leading exercises will not be in a specific style (Classical, Baroque, Romantic, pop/rock, etc.). Instead, these exercises will eliminate important musical elements like <em>harmony</em>, <em>orchestration</em>, <em>melodic motives</em>, <em>formal structure</em>, and even many elements of <em>rhythm</em>, in order to focus very specifically on a small set of musical problems. These other elements of music will be introduced one-by-one as we progress through this course and into future courses.</p><p>The “fundamental musical problems” we will address in the study of counterpoint center around the way in which some basic principles of auditory perception and cognition (how the brain perceives and conceptualizes sound) play out in Western musical structure. For example, our brains tend to assume that sounds similar in pitch or timbre come from the same source. Our brains also listen for patterns, and when a new sound continues or completes a previously heard pattern, it assumes that the new sound belongs together with those others. On the other hand, the breaking of these regularities in the sonic environment can signal danger, or at the very least the need for heightened attention to be applied to the sonic “culprit.” Identifying irregularities in the sonic environment and boosting attention and adrenaline when one is found have been absolutely essential to the survival of the human species. These abilities are also what allows music to have the emotional effect that it does on so many people. Whether or not a composer or songwriter is aware of the science and psychology of hearing, a masterful composer mediates and plays with these basic concepts.</p><p>“Mediates” and “plays” are important ideas here. Music that simply makes it easy for the brain to parse and process sound is boring. It calls for no heightened attention – it doesn’t increase our heart rate or make the hair on the back of our neck stand up or give us a little jolt of dopamine. On the other hand, music that constantly activates our innate sense of danger is hardly pleasant for most listeners. Thus, fundamental to most of the music we will study is the dance between tension and relaxation, motion and rest.</p><p>The study of counterpoint will help us to engage several important musical “problems” in a limited context, so that we can master them compositionally and understand them analytically. Those problems arise as we seek to bring the following traits together:</p><ul><li>smoothness<br />
</li><li>independence and integrity of melodic lines<br />
</li><li>tonal fusion (the preference for simultaneous notes to form a consonant unity)<br />
</li><li>variety<br />
</li><li>motion (towards a goal)</li></ul><p>These traits are based in human perception and cognition, but they are often in conflict in specific musical moments, and need to be balanced over the course of larger passages and complete works. Counterpoint will help us begin to practice mediating these conflicts.</p><p>Also, note Schenker’s expression “lead the ear.” Counterpoint is not a pencil-and-paper (or lecture-and-homework) study. Rather, the exercises are mini- (micro-? nano-?) compositions that must be <em>performed</em>—with voice and/or keyboard, often with a partner—so that the ear, the fingers, the throat, and ultimately the mind can internalize the sound, sight, and feel of good (and bad) musical lines, and good (and bad) combinations of musical lines.</p><p>The specific method we will use is called <em>species counterpoint</em>—so called because the study progresses through stages, or species, where one or two new musical “problems” are introduced. This approach has existed in some form since the early seventeenth century. The specific method we will use is very close to that articulated by Johann Joseph Fux, in his <em>Gradus ad parnassum</em> (<em>Steps to Parnassus</em>, 1725). Master composers from the eighteenth to the twenty-first centuries have used this method, or some variation on it. While Fux proposed five species, moving from two-voice combinations up to six- and eight-voice combinations, we will focus on species one through four, in two voices only.</p><h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3><p>Any lesson could begin with the question, “Why study this it all?” and the discussion of counterpoint is no different. Why should we study counterpoint in a tonal harmony class when there are entire courses in later semesters dedicated to this specific subject?</p><p>First, you should try to conceptualize what counterpoint is in a musical context. Notice the second sentence of the passage above:</p><blockquote><p>“<em>Voice-leading</em> deals with the relationship of two or more musical lines (or melodies) combined into a single musical idea.”</p></blockquote><p>And then, from the second paragraph:</p><blockquote><p>However, of the three [aspects of music], voice-leading is the most fundamental. Thus, we begin our study of music theory, then, with <em>strict voice-leading</em>, or <em>counterpoint</em>.</p></blockquote><p>A brief study of counterpoint is the next step as we work through increasing levels of musical complexity. We began with a single pitch, then combined pitches to create intervals. We then combine intervals to create melodies and combine melodies to create counterpoint. Studying counterpoint allows us to strip away many of the complicating factors of musical harmony and begin to understand the origin of tonality.</p><p>In the next topic, we will establish some basic rules for constructing a simple melody and then look at what happens when we create a second melody that works with the original. It is from these interactions that harmony evolved as we know it, so to study counterpoint is to study the fundamental of Western music.</p><p>Eighteenth century species counterpoint gives us a relatively straightforward set of rules and norms to begin this study. Even though many of these rules are not observed by modern music, we can study the process of how these rules create music and then apply that <em>process</em> to all types of music.</p><p>Finally, consider these two further takeaways from the reading: - Music is a built upon tension and release. - Music is structured to create expectations for the listener and then either fulfill or deny those expectations.</p><p>These observations consider the nature of musical composition in general, because they also demonstrate the fundamentals of counterpoint. Tension, release, and expectations are based on two primary functions: intervals and melodic motion, and we will study these for the rest of this unit.</p><h3 id="class-reading-from-open-music-theory-1">Class reading from <em>Open Music Theory</em></h3><p>The concept of musical functions is foundational to musical analysis, and essential to the understanding of musical styles.</p><p>A musical <em>function</em> describes the role that a particular musical element plays in the creation of a larger musical unit. Function is tied very much to the idea of expectation: given a certain element in a certain context, what element(s) is/are likely to come next? Likewise, how does a given element fulfill or deny the expectations set by what came before it?</p><p>A musical function typically has two defining features: the characteristics of the musical elements that tend to belong to that function (what notes tend to be found in the chord, for example), and the kinds of elements (or functions) that tend to precede or follow it in a succession of musical elements. Note that this is entirely dependent on the typical patterns of a musical <em>style</em>. Different styles of music may exhibit different functions or different behaviors for the same functions. The study of function and the study of style are inextricably linked.</p><p>The two musical traits most commonly studied for their functional properties in Western art and popular music are <em>harmony</em> and <em>form</em>. The study of both harmonic functions and formal functions will lead to an understanding of harmonic and formal <em>syntax</em>: the norms or principles according to which musical elements are combined into meaningful and stylistically appropriate successions. The study of harmony or form, then, is not a matter of learning to label chords, phrases, and modules correctly. It is a matter of <em>interpreting the role that chords, phrases, modules, etc. play in the larger context in which they are found</em>. That, of course, requires fluency in identifying (and thus labeling) individual musical elements. But identification is only the beginning of a much bigger, and more interesting, process of analysis. And it is that analytical work that will lead to true understanding of the pieces of music analyzed, and the styles to which they belong.</p><p>If a musical function describes the role that a particular musical element plays in the creation of a larger musical unit, then <em>a harmonic function describes the role that a particular chord plays in the creating of a larger harmonic progression</em>. Each chord tends to occur in some musical situations more than others, to progress to some chords more than others. These tendencies work together to create meaningful harmonic progressions, which can in turn form the harmonic foundation for musical <em>phrases</em>, <em>themes</em>, and larger formal units.</p><p>Generally speaking, the function of a chord concerns the notes that belong to it (its <em>internal characteristics</em>), the chords that tend to precede and follow it, and where it tends to be employed in the course of a musical phrase.</p><p>A theory of harmonic functions is based on three fundamental principles:</p><ul><li>Chords are collections of scale degrees.<br />
</li><li>Each scale degree has its own tendencies.<br />
</li><li>The collective tendencies of a chord’s scale degrees in combination is the chord’s function.</li></ul><p>(Note the absence of <em>root</em> and <em>quality</em> from consideration here.)</p><p>Because <a href="06-intro-harmonic/1-reading-styletendency.html">tendency is style-specific</a>, the same chord can have different functions in different musical styles. For instance, the kinds of functions we find in classical music are different from those we find in pop/rock songs from the Billboard charts. And though there are some general harmonic traits that are common to most eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Western composers (what we call the “common practice”), when we look in closer detail, we find some significant differences in the way Bach, Mozart, Brahms, and others compose their harmonic progressions.</p><p>Our initial exploration of harmonic functions will engage the general “common practice” that is shared by most eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Western composers. As we explore specific genres, composers, and works within that common practice, we will have opportunity to explore the more nuanced differences between composers, as well as to move beyond common-practice Western art music to include other styles, such as pop/rock.</p><h2 id="class-reading">Class reading</h2><h3 id="from-open-music-theory-by-kris-shaffer">From <em>Open Music Theory</em> by Kris Shaffer</h3><p>In explaining musical styles, <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3267613W/Style_and_music">Leonard Meyer</a> divides musical characteristics into three categories: <em>laws</em>, <em>rules</em>, and <em>strategies</em>. Laws are characteristics of music that are based on human biology and psychology, and as a result laws are more-or-less universal. Rules are culturally conditioned. They are hallmarks of a particular style that are more-or-less universal within the style, but differ from style to style and culture to culture. Finally, strategies are specific ways in which composers work within a style—the things that make one composer’s work sound different from another’s, even if they compose in the same style.</p><p>For the most part, principles of voice-leading or harmonic progression are “rules” according to Meyer’s definitions. They are specific to a style. Or, in some cases, they are shared among a few styles of Western music, but are far from universal. Thus, it can be helpful to think of them as collective traits of some music(s) we seek to understand and emulate, rather than hard-and-fast <em>it-must-be-done-this-way</em> strictures for all musical practice.</p><p>However, these rules are also related to laws, in as much as they represent one set of practices that mediate the various demands on music from basic principles of human auditory perception and cognition. For instance, the prohibition against parallel fifths is a specific way in which Western tonal composers have mediated the conflict between tonal fusion, goal-directed motion, and independence of line. There are many other similar cases.</p><p>Note, however, that while “avoid parallel fifths” takes on the form of what we consider “rules” in day-to-day speech, Meyer’s rules of musical style are different. Meyer’s rules are <em>descriptive</em>: these things tend to happen universally, frequently, rarely, never, in specific situations. “Avoid parallel fifths” is a <em>prescriptive</em> instruction based on that descriptive observation: because parallel fifths occur rarely in this style, and only in specific cases, avoid them in your own strict-style compositions until we have a chance to engage those specific cases — all the while remembering that other styles may have different tendencies.</p><p>That word <em>tendencies</em> is an important one. There are rarely absolutes in the musical parameters we engage most as performers, analysts, composers, listeners, etc. The absolutes of common styles fell into our unconscious background long ago. Instead, what makes each piece, composer, or style special and unique — what we care about — are the little ways in which they bend the “rules,” the ways in which they express, thwart, and play with the tendencies of the style they engage — the ways they play with our expectations as listeners.</p><p>Over time, as we familiarize ourselves with a musical style, the tendencies of the style become <em>expectations</em> in our mind, and composers can, in turn, compose with those listener expectations in mind. Though those tendencies are subjective, and to a large extent statistical, the shared stylistic knowledge and the shared psychological expectancy create a kind of quasi-objective language. That musical “language,” like spoken/written languages, is both reliable and bendable/breakable. The meaningfulness of a piece of music is dependent on that reliability. But its specialness is dependent on the ability for the “rules” of that language to be bent, even broken.</p><p>With this in mind, as we progress in our study of voice-leading, we will encounter more exceptions to the prescriptive rules, even in strict-style composition, and our hard-and-fast strictures will transition more and more into the language of tendency.</p><h2 id="class-reading-1">Class reading</h2><h3 id="from-open-music-theory">From <em>Open Music Theory</em></h3><h4 id="modified-for-this-website-by-sean-butterfield">Modified for this website by Sean Butterfield</h4><p><em>Basso continuo</em> emerged in the seventeenth century as a shorthand notation for keyboardists (typically church organists) who were accompanying a soloist or small ensemble performing a work originally composed for a larger group. For example, if two or three singers were tasked with performing an eight-voice choral work, they could select the most prominent parts to sing, while an organist could cover the rest. Performing five or six lines of contrapuntal choral music could be a significant challenge, so organists needed a way to condense the texture while still preserving the core musical structure to support the vocalists.</p><p>The <em>thorough bass</em> emerged as that shortcut. The “thorough” or “continuous” bass is a musical line that includes the lowest note at any given time. Usually, works would not include a single part that could function as this line, so the organist would alternate between voices, as they exchanged registers or took rests. The resulting line, unlike the regular “bass” part, was “continuous” (or “thorough”)—hence the name <em>thoroughbass</em> or <em>basso continuo</em>.</p><p>A good musician could perform this bass line, and with an eye (or ear) on the vocal parts and with knowledge of how to improvise good voice-leading, that musician could <em>accompany</em> the thoroughbass line with chords that made musical sense. (This is the original meaning of the term accompany—to accompany a bass line with chords. The fact that keyboardists did this in the context of supporting a soloist or small ensemble led to that term later being applied to any situation where a keyboardist <em>accompanied</em> spotlight performers.)</p><p>As this technique grew, publishers began publishing thoroughbass reductions of large-ensemble pieces to support smaller groups of musicians. In these publications, <em>figures</em> (numbers above or below the bass line) were included—sometimes only for difficult or non-standard chords, and eventually for most chords, enabling more amateur musicians, as well as students, to make use of the technique. These bass lines with figures became known as “figured bass” lines.</p><p><a href="images/Bach1033.png"><img src="images/Bach1033.png" /></a></p><p><em>J.S. Bach, Flute Sonata in C Major, ii., BWV 1033. The upper part is played by the flute, the lower part is the</em> basso continuo <em>line, played by a keyboardist who uses the numbers below the staff (figures) to guide the chords played above this bass line.</em></p><p>To this day, harpsichordists performing in Baroque ensembles will often put their left hand to the same “bass” line that the cellos play, and will improvise right-hand chords (with contrapuntally sound embellishment) according to the figures provided with the bass line.</p><p>Though most music students are not Baroque keyboard specialists in training, thoroughbass, or <em>basso continuo</em>, can be a valuable tool in the study of harmony and voice-leading. In the study of harmony, a thoroughbass line can play a valuable role as a harmonic <em>reduction</em> of a complex texture, in order to example and understand better the harmonic skeleton underlying a passage. In aural dictation, transcription, and analysis, the bass line and the melody are often the most prominent (and most important) lines in a passage, and knowing how the inner voices tend to relate to the bass line and melody can aid in a number of listening and aural-analysis tasks. In voice-leading, the <em>basso continuo</em> texture affords a straightforward environment in which to make a gradual, staged progression through the intricacies of writing musical lines in a harmonic texture—and to do so without paying significant attention to harmony.</p><p><em>Basso continuo</em> (It. for “continuous bass” or “thoroughbass”) is essentially a chordal version of first-species counterpoint. However, instead of composing a single line above a cantus firmus, one composes a succession of chords (performed in the right hand) above a bass line (performed in the left hand). <em>Basso continuo</em> writing, also referred to as <em>realizing a figured bass</em>, gives no consideration to melody, only to the use of proper chords and the smoothest voice-leading possible. Thus, <em>basso continuo</em> style is a simple place to begin engaging the “fundamental musical problems” that arise when more than two lines are combined.</p><p>The historical origin of the thoroughbass part was in church settings where a piece for 6–8 singers was to be performed by one or two voices with a keyboard instrument. The keyboardist, rather than play the 4–7 remaining parts, would transcribe the lowest note and shorthand figures to indicate the (simple) intervals present above that lowest voice. This would allow the keyboardist to play one or two of the more important lines, and fill the rest of the texture with blocked or arpeggiated chords. (Think seventeenth-century lead sheet.) A good keyboardist, who knew their harmony and voice-leading, could simply follow the bass line without figures (an <em>unfigured bass</em>) and listen to the melody, improvising the rest. Less experienced keyboardists, however, could manage otherwise complicated pieces by reading a bass line and memorizing a small number of figures and basic voice-leading rules.</p><p>Coming after species counterpoint in our studies, <em>basso continuo</em> exercises provide a new, more complicated environment in which to practice mediating the demands of smoothness, independence of lines, tonal fusion (now considering triads and seventh chords), variety, and motion. New considerations of performability are introduced, and the presence of dissonances within the core harmonies themselves will call for new approaches to harmonic dissonance in this style.</p><p>We will use thoroughbass lines for a number of purposes in this book:</p><ul><li>harmonic “reductions” of pieces and passages with dense textures or complicated voice-leading<br />
</li><li>shorthand representations of stock harmonic patterns<br />
</li><li>the harmonic basis for model composition exercises (akin to the <em>cantus firmus</em> of species counterpoint)</li></ul><p>Thoroughbass is a simple, and foundational, concept. Master it early, and subsequent activities will be much easier.</p><p>Note on figure placement: Thoroughbass figures can appear above or below the bass line. Both are common, but in this book, we generally place them <em>above</em> the bass line. This connects them to our habits of interval analysis during species counterpoint, keeps figures separate from other harmonic symbols we will place below the bass line, and make typesetting in notation software easier when both figures and other symbols are in play simultaneously.</p><h3 id="figures">Figures</h3><p>In general, a thoroughbass figure indicates the <em>simple intervals above the bass</em> for all pitch classes present in the chord.</p><p>The largest number typically found in thoroughbass figures is 7. In general, <em>compound intervals</em> (an octave or larger) are reduced to their <em>simple interval</em> equivalent. A tenth becomes a third, a thirteenth becomes a sixth, etc.</p><p>The most common chords in tonal music are <a href="triads.html"><em>triads</em> and <em>seventh chords</em></a>. The following figures apply to these chords:</p><p><img src="images/harmony/figuresFull.png" /></p><ul><li>5/3: use a fifth and a third above the bass (one note of the chord will be doubled)<br />
</li><li>6/3: use a sixth and a third above the bass (one note of the chord will be doubled)<br />
</li><li>6/4: use a sixth and a fourth above the bass (one note of the chord will be doubled)<br />

</li><li>6/4/3: use a sixth, a fourth, and a third above the bass<br />
</li><li>6/4/2: a use a sixth, a fourth, and a second above the bass</li></ul><p>These figures are so common, that most of them have shortcuts:</p><p><img src="images/harmony/figuresAbbrev.png" /></p><ul><li>no figure = 5/3<br />

</li><li>4/3 = 6/4/3<br />
</li><li>4/2 (or just 2) = 6/4/2</li></ul><p>Other shortcuts for figured bass realization generally follow two simple rules:</p><ul><li>Assume a fifth is present above the bass unless there is a “6” in the figure.<br />
</li><li>Assume a third is present above the bass unless there is a “4” or a “2” in the figure.</li></ul><h3 id="unfamiliar-figures-and-chords">Unfamiliar figures and chords</h3><p>Only seven figures are given above. If you see a figure you do not recognize, simply follow the intervals (using the two shortcut rules). Likewise, if analyzing a chord that is not a triad or seventh chord, simply label the <em>simple</em> intervals you see/hear above the bass, from top to bottom in descending order: 7/6/3 or 5/4, for example. In time, you will become familiar with a number of other harmonic possibilities, and their corresponding figures.</p><h3 id="chords-of-the-fifth-and-chords-of-the-sixth">Chords of the fifth and chords of the sixth</h3><p>All chords can be categorized as either a <em>chord of the fifth</em> or a <em>chord of the sixth</em>. This distinction will be important for our study of voice-leading.</p><p>A <em>chord of the fifth</em> contains a fifth above the bass, but no sixth above the bass.</p><p>A <em>chord of the sixth</em> contains a sixth above the bass.</p><h3 id="chromatic-alteration">Chromatic alteration</h3><p>If a note is chromatically altered (different than the key signature), the figure must be altered as well. Since bass notes are already present in the bass, a chromatic alteration in the bass will not make it into the figure. However, any other alteration in the upper voices (such as a raised leading tone in minor) must be reflected in the figure. To do so, simply put a sharp, flat, or natural to the left of the appropriate number.</p><p>Of course, there are some shortcuts. For example, draw a line (a “slash”) through a number to denote that it is raised by half-step (can substitute both for sharp or for natural). Also, when altering the third above the bass, simply use the sharp, flat, or natural and leave out the “3.”</p><p><img src="images/harmony/figuresChrom.png" /></p><p>In general, if there is a shortcut available, use it. The shortcuts are more standard than the corresponding full notation.</p><p>Keep in mind that some chords have abbreviated figures. For example, it is common for the leading tone to be the third above the bass in a 5/3 chord. In such a situation, a bass note that otherwise would have no figure needs a sharp or a natural for its thoroughbass figure.</p><h3 id="class-discussion">Class discussion</h3><p>TBD</p><p>After having developed voice-leading procedures in Unit 7a, you should now understand why the voice-leading between V and I creates tension and release. This progression defines tonal harmony, and it is from this that we derive our three primary function classifications: tonic, dominant, and pre-dominant function. While it is easy to memorize which chords belong to each of the primary functions, it is more important to understand how and why these functions work. - The most stable harmony is built around the tonic of the key, so stable chords have a <em>tonic</em> function. - The harmonies that pull strongly to <em>tonic</em> function are built around the dominant of the key, so these chords have a <em>dominant</em> function. - There are also harmonies that resolve well to the <em>dominant</em> function chords, so these have a <em>pre-dominant</em> function. - Some systems call these chords <em>subdominant</em> function because they all share the fourth scale degree. We already use words such as “dominant” and “tonic” in a variety of ways (e.g. scale degrees, harmonic function, chord types, etc.), so we will be differentiating pre-dominant from subdominant to create slightly less confusion.</p><p>These harmonic functions shape every musical phrase, and nowhere is that more obvious than in studying how phrases end. <em>Cadences</em> are the term that we use to describe the harmonic progression at the end of a musical phrase. If a musical phrase could be considered equivalent to a written sentence, then the <em>cadence</em> is the period at the end of that sentence. All cadences finish a phrase, but not all cadences provide closure and stability. In fact, some cadences are purposefully unsettled.</p><p>We will study the chords associated with classifying cadences, but it takes far more than a particular harmonic progression to create a cadence. In addition to chord progressions, cadences are affected by melodic shapes, melodic rhythm, harmonic rhythm, context, meter, and many other elements of music.</p><p>For this course, we will study six types of cadences: - <em>perfect authentic cadence (PAC)</em> - <em>imperfect authentic cadence (IAC)</em> - <em>half cadence (HC)</em> - <em>deceptive cadence (DC)</em> - <em>plagal cadence (PC)</em> - <em>phrygian half cadence (PHC)</em></p><p><em>Take special care to remember the abbreviations in parentheses for each cadence type.

In this lesson, we will derive the basic aspects of function by combining two major concepts from previous units: 1. As shown in the two-part examples in <a href="06-intro-harmonic/b1-diafuncvoicelead.html">Unit 6b</a>, the progression from V<sup>7</sup> to I creates a strong and natural sense of resolution. There are many reasons we hear this progression as a strong cadence, but perhaps the strongest reason is the voice-leading between the V<sup>7</sup> and I chords–meaning the way in which individual pitches naturally pull toward each other. 2. When written as a scale, diatonic collections are simply a sequence of five whole steps and two half-steps–the major scale, for example, is W-W-H-W-W-W-H–but as we determined in <a href="02-int-scales-keys/d1-keys.html">Unit 2c</a>, you can find all seven pitches in the diatonic collection by altering a a single half-step in a circle-of-fifths. This alteration changes one of the P5 intervals to a d5, and it is these two pitches within the diatonic collection, <code>ti</code> and <code>fa</code>, that establish the voice leading that pulls V<sup>7</sup> to I and therefore around which tonal harmony is constructed.</p><p>As a side note, the significance of cultural conditioning cannot be overlooked. A person who grows up listening to <em>any</em> style of music will be conditioned to hear the tendencies used in that music as a natural progression, and this holds true for those raised around music descended from the diatonic tradition. This does not change the importance of voice-leading in forming these progressions, but it is worth remembering the difference between laws, rules, and strategies discussed in the first reading from Unit 6.</p><p>The examples below demonstrate how these half-steps create this the foundation of diatonic harmony. If you understand the voice-leading principles that pull the V chord into the I chord, you can then extend these rules to create the basic progression from which all diatonic harmony evolves.</p><h3 id="goals-for-this-topic">Goals for this topic</h3><p>The next five examples are meant to expose the logic behind the voice-leading of standard diatonic harmonies. To use these, study each example before moving on to the next and form a hypothesis regarding the voice leading (which chord tones resolve or pull to other chord tones). Once you have developed a theory as to how and why the progression works, move to the next example to see if your hypothesis can be applied. If it cannot, alter your hypothesis to account for both examples. Continue this way until you have found voice-leading rules that apply to all of the examples.</p><p><strong>This example has two idealized progressions of a V chord resolving to a I chord: one as triads and the other with a seventh chord.</strong> - Study how each voice resolves. - It is tempting to focus on which scale degree resolves to which scale degree (e.g. <code>ti</code> to <code>do</code>), but this does not provide a complete explanation. - Instead focus on the how each chordal member resolves in the progression. This should include the chordal member to which it resolves and the interval necessary to do so. - Try to discern which chordal members have multiple options and which seem locked into a specific resolution. - What pitches are doubled?

While it is possible to continue this pattern through these two chords, in tonal harmony, the IV and vii<sup>o</sup> chords actually function most often as if they are extensions of the ii<sup>7</sup> and V<sup>7</sup> chords respectively. Look at the following example to see voice-leading using both of these chords.

In this case, vi is “replacing” a I chord and assuming a tonic function, so it must be used and voice carefully. See <a href="07-harmonic-functions/c1-cadences.html">Unit 7c</a> (later in this unit) for a full explanation of cadences. - IV can go to I - This is most commonly used at the end of a phrase, and in this case, IV is “replacing” the V chord. This is another cadence, so it must be prepared properly. It is better to avoid using this progression in the middle of a phrase, so in your early attempts at part-writing, do not attempt to use this. - UNCOMMON: vi can move to V - There are instances where vi will move to V, but in these cases, it is best to think of the vi chord as taking on a tonic function. In your early part-writing, do not use this progression, because like V moving to vi–a much more common progression–this progression is likely to result in poor voice-leading. - RARE: iii can move to IV - It is difficult to use this without creating multiple voice-leading issues, so in your early attempts at part-writing, do not attempt to use this.</p><h3 id="changes-in-minor">Changes in Minor</h3><p>Minor follows all of the same progressions and exceptions, but the chord qualities change to match the naturally occurring pitches in the key signature.

In this case, the ^b3 will often be re-spelled to a ^#2, but this does not change the function or labeling of the chord.</p><p>The other option that is commonly used is resolving any augmented sixth chord to a V<sup>7</sup> chord rather than a triad.

As with any colorful chord, however, composers do not restrict themselves to this one usage. Analyze the following example.

The D-flat and B-natural form an augmented sixth that resolves outward by half-step, and the two inner voices create a German<sup>+6</sup>…in a different key.</p><p>These non-dominant resolutions present an issue for standard Roman numeral notation. Before reading on, take a moment and try to come up with a label for the the augmented sixth chord in the previous example. The standard German augmented sixth in that key (C major) would have an A-flat, C, E-flat, and F-sharp, so you cannot simply label it as Ger<sup>+6</sup>.</p><p>Augmented sixth chords are similar to secondary dominant functions in that they embellish a chord using chromatic alterations that strengthen voice leading. A tonicization, however, temporarily treats a non-tonic chord as if it were tonic. Our notation for secondary dominants shows this by using a slash to imply that we are temporarily working in the key of the chord below the slash. In the example above, the augmented sixth chord is the standard Ger<sup>+6</sup> in the key of F major, so some theory methods suggest that you should use a slash to label this as Ger<sup>+6</sup>/IV, because this chord would appear in the key of F major. I find this inadequate because in the key of F major, this chord would function as a pre-dominant harmony whereas it is clearly filling a dominant function here. Other theory methods recommend that this chord be labeled as Ger<sup>+6</sup>/I to show that it is meant to resolve to the I chord, but this fundamentally alters what the slash means. A slash chord above a Roman numeral means “in the key of”; V/V implies a V chord in the key of the dominant. Using Ger<sup>+6</sup>/I would mean the Ger<sup>+6</sup> in the key of I–in this case, C major–but the standard Ger<sup>+6</sup> in the key of C major has A-flat, C, E-flat, and F-sharp.</p><p>Instead, the least ambiguous option for alternate resolutions of augmented sixth chords is to show what <em>pitch</em> the chord is intended to embellish by placing a scale degree below a slash. Therefore, the example above would be labeled as Ger<sup>+6</sup>/^1. Using a scale degree below the slash instead of a Roman numeral makes it clear that the slash is functioning differently than its use in labeling secondary functions.</p><h3 id="practicing-augmented-sixth-chords">Practicing augmented sixth chords</h3><p>Because augmented sixth chords are based entirely on the smooth voice leading that they create, you could use an augmented sixth chord to embellish almost <em>any</em> harmony, although it does work best for major triads and dominant chords. Try this for yourself in the following progression by inserting augmented sixth chords at any spot marked with an x. You may change any note necessary for the chord. Please note that each chord will need a “customized” augmented sixth chord that emphasizes its root; there is no one-size-fits-all augmented sixth chord. For example, if you plan to use Ger<sup>+6</sup>/ii, you would need to make sure that you are using an augmented sixth chord that has an augmented sixth that resolves outward by half-step to ^2.</p><p>{% capture ex7 %}X:7 T:Inserting augmented sixth chords T:for varying chords M:4/4 L:1/2 K:C V:1 [cE][cE]| [cE][cE]| <a href="cantusFirmus.html">cF</a>| [dF][dF]| [c2]|] V:2 clef=bass [C,G,][C,G,]| [A,,A,][A,,A,]| [F,,A,][F,,A,]| [G,,B,][G,,B,]| [C,2]|] w:C:I x vi x IV x V7 x I{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“7” abc=ex7 %}</p><h3 id="what-is-a-modulation">What is a modulation?</h3><p>A <em>modulation</em> occurs in a tonal piece of music when the tonic pitch changes. Most musicians understand this concept on an intuitive level, but there are a few common misconceptions. - Modulations are sometimes referred to as a “key change,” but the key signature does not necessarily need to be altered for a modulation to occur. Repeated accidentals are a more consistent hint that a modulation may have happened. - The term “key change” also does not account for the fact that a shift between the parallel major and minor modes (e.g. C major to C minor) is <em>not</em> a modulation but do have different key signatures. This is a shift in mode – not a modulation – because the tonic does not change.</p><h3 id="key-relationships">Key relationships</h3><p>In our first studies of modulation, we will look at modulations between closely-related keys. <em>Closely-related keys</em> are keys that are within one accidental of each other. Each key has five closely-related keys. To practice, write the closely-related keys for: - C major - A minor - C-sharp major - E-flat minor</p><p>When determining closely-related keys, it is helpful to think of the <em>relative</em> major and minor keys as well as their closely-related keys, but the <em>parallel</em> major or minor is always a distantly-related key.</p><h4 id="conclusions-7">Conclusions</h4><p>Any key will have five closely related keys: two of the same mode, and three of the opposite mode. You can find these quickly by finding the relative major/minor key of the starting key, and then adding one sharp and one flat to both of these keys. For example, C major has a relative minor of A minor. If you add a sharp to both of those key signatures you get G major and E minor. If you add a flat to both of those key signatures, you get F major and D minor.

Some modulations will be obvious, but others can be contentious. Because a modulation is defined by a change in the tonic, it is necessary to consider how music establishes tonic in the listener’s ear. In earlier units, we discussed the importance of phrasing and cadences, but the following exercise will further clarify their importance.</p><p>On a scratch piece of paper, do the following for each of the examples below: 1. Listen to the entire excerpt, and at the end, sing the tonic (<code>do</code>). Use your ear-training while looking at the final chord to determine which pitch you sang. Write this on your scratch paper. - If you are struggling to identify your tonic, try singing along with the soprano line. Once you arrive at the cadence, sing up and down the scale until you arrive at something that feels completely stable. You should then be able to count the scale degrees through which you must move to arrive at <code>do</code>. 2. Listen to the excerpt again, but pause each time you come to the end of a phrase. Most of the phrases in the excerpts below are marked by fermatas, but you should be able to identify cadences as aurally as well. Each time you pause the excerpt, sing your current <code>do</code>. This may require you to find a pitch that is not present in the chord because some of the phrase endings do not have <code>do</code> in the chord. (i.e. if there is a half cadence) 3. Compare your tonics from each phrase. Does it change throughout the excerpt? If so, you should be able to pinpoint the phrase in which it modulated.</p><p>Some of these examples modulate, yet some are only tonicizations. What do all of the modulations have in common? What about the tonicizations? How does this change your perception of modulation? Is there some commonality among the modulations that will help you visually identify a modulation if you do not have access to playback or a recording?</p><p>Above all else, you will notice that we are not beginning our discussion of modulation by looking at this from a theoretical perspective. Modulation is determined by the listener, and you will often find yourself disagreeing with others. In many cases, modulation is subjective, but this becomes more concrete with experience.</p><p>After you have finished listening to each of these and feel that you have an opinion on whether each modulated, go on to the next unit to begin studying the most common methods that composers use to modulate.</p><p>{% capture ex1 %}X:1 T:Bach - Chorale - Erkenne mich, mein Huter T:(simplified) M:4/4 L:1/4 K:E Q:1/4=65 V:1 [EG]| [Ec] [EB] [A/2E][A/2F] [GE]| [FE] [FD] H[GE] [Fd]| [Ee] [eG] [dG] [dF]| H[c3E]|] V:2 clef=bass [E,B,]| [A,A,] [B,G,] [C,/2C][D,/2B,] [B,E,]| [A,,C] [B,,B,] H[E,B,] [D,^B,]| [G,C,] [E,C] [G,C] [^B,G,,]| H[C,3C]|] w:E:{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“1” abc=ex1 %}</p><p>{% capture ex2 %}X:2 T:Bach - Chorale No. 108 T:(Original key = E-flat) M:4/4 L:1/4 K:E Q:1/4=75 V:1 [EB,]| [EB] [GB] [Ac] [Gd]| [G2e] H[Ge] [cg]| <a href="cantusFirmus.html">cf</a> [eA] [eG] [dF]| H[e3G]|] V:2 clef=bass [E,G,]| [G,B,] [E,E] [A,E] [^B,,D]| [C,2C] H[C,C] [CE]| [A,C] [F,C] [B,B,] [B,B,,]| H[E,3B,]| w:E:{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“2” abc=ex2 %}</p><p>{% capture ex3 %}X:3 T:Bach - Chorale no. 95 T:(simplified) M:4/4 L:1/4 K:Bb Q:1/4=70 V:1 [dF] [eG] [fB] [fB]| [eA] [dB] [cA] H[cA]| [dB] [eG] [fF] [eG]| [cG] <a href="cantusFirmus.html">cF</a> H[B2F]| <a href="cantusFirmus.html">cF</a> [dF] [eE] [eG]| [d_A] [dG] H[c2E]|] V:2 clef=bass [B,B,] [G,B,] [D,B,] [G,D]| [C,E] [D,F] [F,F] H[F,F]| [B,,F] [C,C] [D,A,] [G,B,]| [E,B,] [F,A,] H[B,,2D]| w:Bb: [F,A,] [D,=B,] [C,C] [E,C]| [F,C] [G,=B,] H[C,2G,]|]{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“3” abc=ex3 %}</p><p>{% capture ex4 %}X:4 T:Beethoven - Die Ehre Gottes aus der Natur T:reduction M:4/4 L:1/4 K:C Q:1/4=100 V:1 [GFDB,] [GFDB,] [GFDB,] [GFDB,]| [c2C] G2| E2 C [eG]| [e2G] [dF] [cE]| [c2E] H[BD] G| [f2F] [d2D]| [B2B,]&gt; [G2G,]| [c2EC] [d2BGD]| [e2cGE]&gt; [e2cGE]| [e2^cAE]&gt; [e2cAE]| [f2dAF]&gt; [d2AD]| [g2ecG] [B2GDB,]| [c2GEC]&gt; [e’2c’ge]| [e’2c’ge] z2| z2 z|] V:2 clef=bass [G,,F,D,B,,] [G,,F,D,B,,][G,,F,D,B,,][G,,F,D,B,,]| [C,,2C,] [G,2G,,]| [E,2E,,] [C,C,,] [C,G,]| [C,2G,] [B,,G,] [C,G,]| [G,2G,,] H[G,G,,] [G,G,,]| w:C: [F,2F,,] [D,2D,,]| [B,,2B,,,]&gt; [G,,,2G,,]| [A,,2A,,,] [G,,,2G,,]| [C,2C,,]&gt; [C2C,]| [A,2^C,A,,E,]&gt; [A,2^C,A,,E,]| [D,2DA,F,]&gt; [F,2F,,]| [G,2C,E,G,,] [G,,,2G,,]| [C,,2G,,E,,C,]&gt; [C,,2G,,E,,C,]| [C,,2G,,E,,C,]&gt; [C,,2G,,E,,C,E,G,C]| H[C,,2G,,E,,C,E,G,C]&gt;|]{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“4” abc=ex4 %}</p><p>{% capture ex5 %}X:5 T:Tchaikovsky - Symphony No. 5, Mvt.

As you look at it further, it should be clear that this G is <em>functional</em>–it is critical to the texture and structure of this chord–so we must consider it a chord tone, making this harmony an F<sup>maj9</sup> chord. Measure 3 has a similar issue with the E in the melody over the G7</p><p>As we have discussed repeatedly in this course, harmonic analysis is the art of determining which pitches are functional to the harmony and which pitches are embellishment. As we move into an expanded view of tonal harmony, it is imperative that you are extremely familiar with the details of non-chord tones in Unit 9a, because these shapes will provide a foundation to help you begin determining what is functional. Simply put, if you cannot label a pitch as one of the possible non-chord tone shapes, then it is most likely a functioning chord tone.

Also, take note of how the roots of chords are affected. The ii chord has a root of <code>re</code> in either the major or minor mode and changes only in quality from a D minor to a D diminished chord. The vi chord undergoes a more substantial change, because not only does its quality change from minor to major, but it does this by changing the actual root of the chord from <code>la</code> to <code>le</code>. Forgetting to alter the root when borrowing chords from different modes is one of the most common mistakes that students make when studying borrowed chords in mode mixture, so always check your roots before building the chord.</p><p>Perhaps more importantly than even understanding which chords can be borrowed, you must look at how they function.

So even though the quality of this ii chord has changed and is no longer diatonic, the meaning of the Roman numeral doesn’t change unless you alter it with further information such as labeling it as a passing or pedal chord.

For unordered pcs, you should always notate this using <strong>parentheses with a comma between each pitch class</strong>. The following are all examples of unordered pc sets:</p><ul><li>(0,1,5,t)</li><li>(B-flat,C,D,G)</li><li>(2,4)</li><li>(0,1,3,5,6,7,8,9,e)</li><li>(B,C,D,E,F,G,A)</li></ul><p>You will notice that it doesn’t matter if you use pitch names or integer notation; a pitch class set is any collection of pitch classes.</p><h3 id="modulo-12-arithmetic">Modulo 12 arithmetic</h3><p>Before we begin using integer notation to study pitch classes and pitch-class sets, we must establish the mathematical method necessary for manipulating pitches. Because music uses twelve equally-spaced pitches but our standard counting system is based around tens, we must create a specific equivalency around the number 12. For this, we use modulo 12 (mod12) arithmetic. You already use modulo 12 arithmetic every time you count time in hours, assuming that you use a 12-hour system. For example, if it is 11:00 and you have a meeting in three hours, what time is your meeting? From experience, you understand that when you reach 12, you must reset your counting to find the meeting’s start time at 2:00–not 14:00. (Again, this assumes that you are not using a 12-hour clock cycle, not 24-hour.)</p><p>This is exactly how pitch-class integer notation works, although the system begins numbering on 0 instead of 12. In this system, each time you pass 11, you begin again at zero, therefore making every multiple of 12 equal to zero.

Do you find the first pitch and then as the base for finding the rest of the intervals?</p><p>Next: - Convert this pitch-class set into integer notation - Then add 5 to each number - For any resulting number greater that 11, convert that number to its lowest possible integer using mod12 from above. - For example, if you were to get 13, you would need to subtract 12 to get 1. - Convert this new set of integers into pitch letter names.</p><p>Did you get the same result as when you transposed the pitches using the traditional method for pitch transposition?

The pc set becomes (4,5,7,t), and then when you add 5 to each integer it becomes (9,t,12,15). All numbers greater than 11 must be reduced by mod12, so the set becomes (9,t,0,3). When these numbers are converted back into pitch letter names, you get (A,B-flat,C,E-flat) which is exactly a P4 above the original pc set.</p><p>This works, of course, because <em>the numbers in integer notation actually represent the number of half-steps above a given pitch</em>.

While working through this, how many permutations in ascending order are there for a this set? How does that number relate to the cardinality for any set?

You can imagine this using a clock face–each pitch class must go in the order it would if you move clockwise around the clock without skipping any pitch classes. For this pentachord, let’s start with:<ol type="1"><li>(2,3,5,8,e)</li></ol></li><li><strong>List every possible ascending arrangements of the pc set.</strong> There will always be the same number of arrangements as there are members of the pc set, because each integer will have <em>one</em> ascending arrangement with it as a starting pitch class. For a pentachord, there will always be five possibilities, and for this particular pc set, they are:<ol type="1"><li>(2,3,5,8,e)</li><li>(3,5,8,e,2)</li><li>(5,8,e,2,3)</li><li>(8,e,2,3,5)</li><li>(e,2,3,5,8)</li></ol></li><li><strong>Subtract the first number <em>from</em> the last number for each ascending arrangement.</strong> This will give you the interval between the outer pitch classes expressed as a number of half-steps. If the last number is smaller than the first number, you must use mod12 to convert it. For most students, it is easiest to add 12 to the smaller number before subtracting, but after you have practiced, you can apply this to the result if you’d like. For example above:<ol type="1"><li>(2,3,5,8,e) | e-2 = 11-2 = <em>9</em></li><li>(3,5,8,e,2) | 2-3 (requires mod 12) = 14-3 = <em>11</em></li><li>(5,8,e,2,3) | 3-5 (requires mod 12) = 15-5 = <em>10</em></li><li>(8,e,2,3,5) | 5-8 (requires mod 12) = 17-8 = <em>9</em></li><li>(e,2,3,5,8) | 8-e (requires mod 12) = 20-11 = <em>9</em></li></ol></li><li><strong>The normal form is the ascending arrangement with the smallest outer interval. If you have multiple arrangements with the same outer interval, you must proceed to the first tie-breaker.</strong> In our above example, we have three options with an outer interval of 9 (M6). (At this point, we have eliminated the two arrangements that had the larger outer intervals of 10 and 11.) We must compare each of the tied arrangements against each other to determine which example has the <em>next</em> smallest outer interval. You can do this easily by subtracting the second-to-last number from the first number, so for our remaining three with the outer interval of 9, we get:<ol type="1"><li>(2,3,5,8,e) | 8-2 = <em>6</em></li><li>(8,e,2,3,5) | 3-8 (requires mod12) = 15-8 = <em>7</em></li><li>(e,2,3,5,8) | 5-e (requires mod12) = 17-11 = <em>6</em></li></ol></li><li><strong>If there is still a tie, repeat the process for the remaining ascending orders, but using the third-to-last pitch class for your subtraction.</strong> Sometimes, this can move through multiple tie-breakers, so just continue moving inward through the arrangements. The previous example still had a tie between the first and last arrangement, so we have to go one last round:<ol type="1"><li>(2,3,5,8,e) | 5-2 = <em>3</em></li><li>(e,2,3,5,8) | 3-e (requires mod12) = 15-11 = <em>4</em></li></ol></li><li><strong>Once you have only one smallest interval, you have found the normal form for that pc set.</strong> Remember that you must change your notation to include square brackets once you have determined normal form. For our example above, our normal form is:<ol type="1"><li>[2,3,5,8,e]</li></ol></li></ol><p>Note that there cannot be a definitive normal form for symmetrical sets such as diminished seventh chords, augmented triads, and whole-tone scales. For these, it is simplest to list the lowest integer first.</p><p>Near the beginning of the course, we familiarized ourselves with the common scales necessary for learning diatonic function: major, natural minor, melodic minor, harmonic minor, major pentatonic, minor pentatonic, and chromatic scales. If you need to refresh your memory of those scales, please review Unit 2.</p><h3 id="non-diatonic-scales">Non-diatonic scales</h3><p>Most music–whether folk, pop, jazz, classical, etc.–can organize the pitches into what you would identify as a scale, but in most of these styles, rarely do these scales conform to a simple major or minor scale. Some of these scales, like the various diatonic <em>modes</em> and the pentatonic collection, are relatively familiar to most listeners. Others–such as octatonic and whole tone collections/scales–are more novel, and most often associated with compositions of the last 100 years.</p><p>When characterizing scales, the word “collection” is often more appropriate than “scale.” A <em>collection</em> is any group of notes–usually five or more–that can be ordered in an ascending and repeating fashion. Imagine a collection as a source from which a composer can draw musical material–a kind of “soup” within which pitch-classes float freely. Collections by themselves do not imply a tonal center. But in a composition, a composer may establish a tonal center by privileging one note of the collection, which we then call a <em>scale</em>.</p><p><strong>Use the following arrangements of <em>Happy Birthday</em> to determine the intervallic pattern of each of these scales/collections.

Interestingly, the whole tone scale is one of the few collections of pitches that is both symmetrical and constructed entirely of one interval. It shares this trait with a fully diminished seventh chord (all minor thirds) and an augmented triad (all major thirds). Any whole tone scale also contains two augmented triads, separated by a M2.</p><p>Because there are only six pitches, you will have to choose to insert a skip of a diminished third when writing a whole tone scale on a staff, assuming that you want to keep your tonic the same in every octave. If you stack only use major seconds, your octave will be an enharmonic equivalent. There is no preferred place to put the interval of a third; most people just place it where it eliminates as many accidentals as possible.</p><p>The symmetry of the whole tone scale means that there are actually only two unique whole tone collections, because you can use any pitch of a given whole tone scale as a tonic.

By alternating these intervals, you can create a six-note scale which we will label as either a 1+3 hexatonic scale or a 3+1 hexatonic scale. Like the whole-tone scale, 1+3/3+1 hexatonic scales contain two augmented triads, but in this case, the two triads are separated by a minor second.</p><p>We always label these hexatonic scales by looking at the first two intervals when the scale is written in <em>ascending</em> form. This often confuses students, because when you write this scale in descending form, the first interval will be the opposite of the name. For example, look at the 1+3 hexatonic scale starting on C:</p><p>C-C#-E-F-G#-A-C</p><p>You can clearly see that this scale begins with a minor second and then alternates with minor thirds. If you write it in descending form, however, the first interval is a m3. To avoid this confusion, we will always label these based on their ascending form.</p><p>3+1 and 1+3 hexatonic scales do not have symmetry as obvious as the whole tone scale, but they do have strong symmetrical traits. There are only four unique 1+3/3+1 collections, because like the whole tone scale, each note of a given collection can be used to form another hexatonic scale. For example, if we examine the C 1+3 hexatonic scale above, you can see that this are also the same pitches for the E 1+3, and G# 1+3 scales. If you arrange this scale to start on C#, F, or A, you would create the 3+1 hexatonic scales for those three pitches.

Both: - consist of an alternating pattern of two intervals - contain two standard, symmetrical chords separated by a half-step - can be transformed into another version of the octatonic scale by reassigning tonic to any pitch in the collection</p><p>The differentiator between the two scales is the intervallic pattern. The octatonic scale alternates between minor seconds and major seconds, as opposed to the 1+3/3+1 hexatonic scales’ minor seconds and minor thirds. The slightly smaller interval pattern of the octatonic creates a collection of eight pitches with many symmetrical properties. And like hexatonic scales, we will always label an octatonic scale starting from its first interval <em>in its ascending form</em>, because in its descending form the pattern will be reversed. If the first interval of your ocatonic scale is a minor second, you will label this as a half-whole (HW) octatonic scale; if the first interval is a major second, you will label this a whole-half (WH) octatonic scale.</p><p>You can divide any octatonic collection into two fully diminished seventh chords, as demonstrated in the C Half-whole (HW) scale written out here.</p><p>C-C#-Eb-E-F#-G-A-Bb-C</p><p>You can see that this collection can be separated into a C<sup>o7</sup> and a C#<sup>o7</sup> (If you do not see this, make sure to consider all of the enharmonic equivalents). And because a fully diminished seventh chord is symmetrical–as we discussed when studying them for enharmonic modulations in Unit 20b–we can then infer that this scale would have an identical interval pattern if we started on any of the pitches of that diminished seventh chord. For example, if you rearrange the collection to ascend from Eb, F#, or A–the other members of the C<sup>o7</sup>–you will find that the resulting scale is still alternating between minor seconds and major seconds, just with a different tonic.</p><p>Also like the 1+3/3+1 hexatonic scales, if we start the scale from the other pitches–for the C HW listed above, these would be the pitches of the other diminished seventh chord, C#, E, G, and Bb of the C#<sup>o7</sup>–you create a scale based on the <em>other</em> octatonic scale pattern, the WH. Therefore, every octatonic collection contains four HW octatonic scales and four WH octatonic scales, which means that there are only three unique octatonic collections.</p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>The three octatonic collections</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th><th>6</th><th>7</th><th>8</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>1</td><td>C</td><td>Db</td><td>Eb</td><td>E</td><td>F#</td><td>G</td><td>A</td><td>Bb</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>2</td><td>C#</td><td>D</td><td>E</td><td>F</td><td>G</td><td>Ab</td><td>Bb</td><td>B</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>3</td><td>D</td><td>Eb</td><td>F</td><td>Gb</td><td>Ab</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>4</td><td>Eb</td><td>E</td><td>F#</td><td>G</td><td>A</td><td>Bb</td><td>C</td><td>Db</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The octatonic scale has long been a favorite of modern composers, because it not only has the tonal fluidity and symmetry of a hexatonic scales, but it also contains many of standard tonal structures such as triads and seventh chords. In a HW octatonic scale, you can create a major triad, minor triad, diminished triad, minor seventh chord, dominant seventh chord, and fully diminished seventh triad off of four of different pitches within the collection. This gives composers an amazing flexibility to use tonally familiar structures in a non-standard manner.</p><h3 id="secondary-dominant-functions-for-chords-other-than-v">Secondary dominant functions for chords other than V</h3><p>At the end of the Unit 14a, you completed the process of transforming a ii<sup>7</sup> chord into V<sup>7</sup>/V.

(This will work for any voicing that you chose, but I have inserted the voicing that I used in the next example.) On the staff below, I have isolated the ii and V chords in the first two measures.

To try this, take your completed progression from the first example above and alter the one pitch necessary in the ii chord to “borrow” the dominant chord from G major. (I have provided you with my voicing if you deleted yours, but feel free to copy your voices into the appropriate lines of the ABC notation.)</p><p>{% capture ex3 %}X:3 T:Changing ii into a dominant chord M:4/4 L:1/2 K:C Q:1/4=80 V:1 [cE] [cE]| [dF] [dG]| [c2E]|] V:2 clef=bass [C,G,] [A,,A,]| [D,A,] [G,,B,]| [C2C,2]|] w:C:I vi ii V I{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“3” abc=ex3 %}</p><h4 id="conclusion-5">Conclusion</h4><p>To do this, you only need to raise the third of the ii chord to create a D major triad–the V chord in the key of G major.

We call this <em>tonicization</em>. It is the process of borrowing the dominant function from a non-tonic chord’s key to provide emphasis and prolong a chord’s function.</p><p>Tonicization is a <em>secondary function</em>. When studying function in diatonic contexts we discussed the primary functions of tonic, dominant, and pre-dominant, as well as tertiary functions such as cadential, passing, pedal, and arpeggiated. Secondary function is yet another category of functions in which the primary functions–i.e. the tonic and dominant relationship–<em>of a second key</em> are used in our original key.</p><h3 id="labeling-secondary-dominant-chords">Labeling secondary dominant chords</h3><p>In the example above, the ii chord becomes a major chord once the sharp is added, so it is no longer a ii chord. To denote this in our Roman numerals, we use two Roman numerals separated by a slash: V/V. We read this as “five of five.” In this labeling, the Roman numeral before the backslash is the chord’s function as if it were <em>in the key of</em> the Roman numeral after the slash. In our example above, the D minor chord becomes a D major chord, so it now acts as the V chord in the key of G major: a “five of five.”</p><p>One important note, standard practice for secondary function chords allows you to tonicize any chord that is <em>not</em> a diminished triad. This means that vii<sup>o</sup> in major and minor as well as ii<sup>o</sup> in minor should not be tonicized.</p><p>Because we label secondary functions in Roman numerals using slashes, students often confuse the function of the slash with leadsheet symbols. In leadsheet symbols, a slash denotes an inversion to the chord by denoting which pitch is in the bass voice, where in Roman numerals, we use <em>inversion figures</em> to denote the bass note. A slash in Roman numerals implies a secondary function and tells you what key is being tonicized. While both systems are useful for theorists, you must be careful not to let the nomenclature mix together.</p><h3 id="secondary-dominant-seventh-chords">Secondary dominant seventh chords</h3><p>In our progression above, what would happen if we had decided to use a ii<sup>7</sup> chord instead of a ii chord? Try it on the following staff. Start by harmonizing the ii<sup>7</sup>-V-I progression below while making sure that you resolve your chordal thirds and sevenths correctly.

What will you call it once you have altered it? We will fully examine these ideas in Unit 15.</p><h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3><p>Now that you have some guidelines in the form of stylistic rules, let’s begin developing the process for composing your own part-writing. How would you go about harmonizing the following melody in a four-part chorale style? Before you begin, look at the example and make a list of all the things you would need to do to harmonize this melody.</p><p>{% capture ex1 %}X:1 T:Melody M:4/4 L:1/4 K:C V:1 cedf| gfed| c4|] V:2 clef=bass xxxx| xxxx| x4|]{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“1” abc=ex1 %}</p><p>In no particular order, you will need to determine: - Harmonies - Harmonic rhythm - Cadences - Bass lines - Inner voices - Texture</p><p>To this point in the course, we have discussed each of these, but you have spent most of your assignments analyzing existing examples rather than creating your own music.</p><p>And as a reminder, if you did not access our guide to part-writing in the last unit, you can find it here. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s9Xd3LPqoaEevshTopxHzLX9jCzxVCZocOBLD_dceMU/edit?usp=sharing">Part-Writing Error Checklist and Guide</a> We will continue referencing this for the rest of the unit, so you will probably want to print this out or open it in a separate window.</p><h3 id="two-important-concepts-to-review-before-beginning">Two important concepts to review before beginning</h3><p>After looking at the list of concepts that are needed to harmonize a melody, you probably feel daunted and combining so many concepts into a single, coherent piece of music. So instead of bringing in every nuance to start, I’d like to draw your attention to two major concepts that will act as your overarching guides for managing your melodic (horizontal) and harmonic (vertical) choices.</p><h4 id="concept-1---manage-the-horizontal-aspect-through-melody-and-tendency-tones">CONCEPT 1 - Manage the horizontal aspect through melody and tendency tones</h4><p>First, you should always prioritize making smooth, singable part in this style. Your bass line will likely have more leaps, but the upper three voices should predominantly use stepwise motion. Any leaps should be followed by stepwise motion in the opposite direction.</p><p>In Unit 7a, we showed that by studying the voice-leading of a simple V (or V<sup>7</sup>) to I progression, we can propose a broad set of voice-leading rules that explain circle-of-fifths diatonicism. Specifically: - For chords that have roots separated by a P5: - The <em>seventh</em> of the first chord resolves to the <em>third</em> of the second chord. - the <em>third</em> of the first chord resolves to the <em>root</em> of the second chord. - If both chords are in root position, the bass voice moves from the <em>root</em> of the first chord to the <em>root</em> of the next chord.</p><p>This is the beginning of a <em>circle-of-fifths progression</em>: a progression in which each chord root follows the circle of fifths.</p><h4 id="concept-2---manage-the-veritcal-aspect-through-stylistic-rules">CONCEPT 2 - Manage the veritcal aspect through stylistic rules</h4><p>Voice-leading governs the horizontal axis of music by shaping the melodies within each voice, but we need some basic rules to guide the vertical stacking of these melodies to make harmonies. A basic four-part chorale style employs the following four rules to act as general guidelines as a framework for combining voices.</p><ul><li>Range<ul><li>Use the treble and bass staves as your guide.<ul><li>Your soprano should sit between the bottom line of the treble clef staff to a ledger line above the treble clef staff.</li><li>The alto voice can go as low two ledger lines below the treble clef staff and up to the top of the treble clef.</li><li>The tenor voice will typically range from the middle of the bass clef staff to three ledger lines above the bass clef staff.</li><li>The bass voice will range from the top of the bass clef staff to a ledger line below the bass clef staff.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Spacing<ul><li>Your upper three voices should never have more than an octave between adjacent voices. The soprano and tenor <em>can</em> be more than an octave apart though.</li><li>Your bass can be as more than an octave from the tenor.</li></ul></li><li>Doubling<ul><li>If you need to double a pitch, you can double (or even triple!) the root of most chords, and you should generally avoid doubling the chordal third and seventh. You can omit the chordal fifth if necessary, but the other pitches cannot be omitted entirely.</li></ul></li><li>Voice-crossing<ul><li>In your early attempts at part-writing, do not allow your voices to cross.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="a-first-attempt-at-part-writing">A first attempt at part-writing</h3><p>Let’s use these two main concepts to try to harmonize the simple melody below with one harmony per pitch. Work through harmonizing the melody below, and take notes on each decision you have to make as your work through the process. If you get stuck, go back and look at the two major concepts to see if one of them gives you an idea how to proceed. And once you have finished, analyze your chorale to check for errors.</p><p>{% capture ex2 %}X:2 T:A first attempt at part-writing M:4/4 L:1/2 K:C V:1 [c] [A]| [B] [c]|] V:2 clef=bass x x| x x|] w:C:{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“2” abc=ex2 %}</p><h4 id="conclusions-14">Conclusions</h4><p>As you started, you hopefully realized that you had to make some important choices first such as choosing your key and cadences. By the end, you should have created a process similar to the following.</p><p><strong>To harmonize a melody in a four-part chorale style, you should:</strong> - <strong>Identify the key</strong> - Look for melodic patterns, starting pitches, and ending pitches for clues as to an implied key. - <strong>Determine your phrase</strong> - For the excerpt below, you have little room for decision making, but for a larger melody, try singing the phrase repeatedly and listen to your natural inclination for breaths or pauses. - It can also be helpful to look for spots in which the rhythm slows naturally. - <strong>Choose a cadence</strong> to complete your phrase. - Refer to <a href="08-cadences-phrasing/a1-cadences.html">Unit 8a</a> to review the types of cadences. - <strong>Create the rest of the diatonic progression</strong> beginning on tonic and ending with your cadence. (If not already provided.) - Beginning on tonic will establish your key center. Refer to <a href="06-intro-harmonic/b1-diafuncvoicelead.html">Unit 6b</a> for a review of the three primary harmonic functions: tonic, dominant, and pre-dominant. - Refer to <a href="07-harmonic-functions/a1-diaprogcirclefifths.html">Unit 7a</a> to determine a functional harmonic progression. - <strong>Compose a bass line</strong> based on your harmonization. - This will resemble 1:1 counterpoint, so you can refer to <a href="05-counterpoint-embell-shapes/b1-cantfirmand1st.html">Unit 5b</a>. - It is okay for the bass line to be more disjunct than the other voices, so feel free to leave your chords in root position to make doubling simpler. - You can alter one or more of these once you begin looking at how it interacts with your melody. Contrary motion against the soprano line is less likely to create issues. - <strong>Fill in the alto and tenor voices.</strong> - Refer to the guidelines for voicing, range, and doubling in <a href="10-intro-harmonic/a1-voiceleadingerrors.html">Unit 10a</a>. - When writing your parts, always <strong>strive to have voice-leading that is as smooth as possible</strong> by emphasizing stepwise motion. - As mentioned above, bass lines are the exception and will often have more leaps, especially when using root-position chords. - <strong>Check your work</strong> - Listen to your finished phrase repeatedly. It doesn’t matter whether you play your phrase on piano or via musical notation software; it only matters that you listen to it. - Analyze your chorale for part-writing errors using the system we discussed in Unit 10. - Does your phrase sound convincing when played? If not, restructure your harmony and try again.</p><h3 id="moving-forward">Moving forward</h3><p>Please do not be afraid of failing! This is a normal and important part of the learning process, so rather than be disappointed, try focusing on the parts that you do not like, and then analyze them for errors. Your first attempts may sound clunky and unconvincing, but you should be able to use the analytical tools that you have developed thus far to find mistakes. Iteration is key.</p><p>As you move the list above, you should realize that a four note melody such as this leaves little room for development, so it is easiest to stick with a simple ideas. Because <code>C</code> is in prominent positions at the beginning and end of the example, use C major for your key. And since the melody ends on the tonic, an authentic cadence would be easiest. With those two decisions made, everything else begins to fall into place.</p><p>To keep this simple, let’s choose a perfect authentic cadence. This locks in the bass line for our last two notes, because we know that a PAC has a root position V and I chords at the end of the phrase. It is hopefully clear that the first pitch should start on the tonic chord to establish the key in our ear, which leaves only the second chord undetermined.</p><p>Because the chord that <em>follows</em> our undetermined chord is a dominant chord, it makes sense to use a pre-dominant chord, and the <code>A</code> in the melody would allow for either a ii chord or a IV chord. (If you are struggling to remember the standard diatonic chord progressions, please refer to Refer to <a href="07-harmonic-functions/a1-diaprogcirclefifths.html">Unit 7a</a>.)Let’s choose an inverted ii chord to provide some variety.</p><p>{% capture ex3 %}X:3 T:A first attempt at part-writing M:4/4 L:1/2 K:C V:1 [c] [A]| [B] [c]|] V:2 clef=bass [C,] [F,] | [G,] [C,]|] w:C:I ii6 V7 I w:T P D T{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“3” abc=ex3 %}</p><p>You now can refer to the handout to see if we met some basic criteria: - Our chords follow a standard progression. - It establishes a key and then cadences in that key. - The lines emphasize smooth voice-leading.</p><p>We are now ready to add inner voices, and we can use our voicing and doubling rules from Unit 6b to establish a first chord.</p><p>{% capture ex4 %}X:4 T:A first attempt at part-writing M:4/4 L:1/2 K:C V:1 [cE] [A]| [B] [c]|] V:2 clef=bass [C,G,] [F,] | [G,] [C,]|] w:C:I ii6 V7 I w:T P D T{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“4” abc=ex4 %}</p><p>And lastly, we can create the alto and tenor lines while observing the melodic guidelines from the handout. - Individual lines should create smooth voice-leading using primarily stepwise motion. - Resolve tendency tones as we studied in our voice-leading discussions (Unit 6b.)</p><p>Leading to…</p><p>{% capture ex5 %}X:5 T:A first attempt at part-writing M:4/4 L:1/2 K:C V:1 [cE] [AD]| [BF] [cE]|] V:2 clef=bass [C,G,] [F,A,] | [G,G,] [C,G,]|] w:C:I ii6 V7 I w:T P D T{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“5” abc=ex5 %}</p><p>Of note, you may have tried to jump to a <code>D</code> for the first beat of the second measure in the tenor line, but this creates an unnecessarily disjunct tenor part. As we studied in Unit 6b, the chordal fifth can be ommitted on a seventh chord if the root is doubled.</p><p>Therefore, if we use only the tools that we have developed thus far in the course, we can already create a simple four-part chorale.</p><p>Now that we have a functional understanding of diatonic harmony, we can begin analyzing scores that use instruments other than voice or piano, but to so, you will need to understand how to read music composed for transposing instruments.</p><h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2><p>For various practical and historical reasons, <em>transposing instruments</em> produce a different sounding pitch than the one written on the page. For example, when a B-flat clarinet sees a written ‘C,’ that pitch will sound as a ‘B-flat.’</p><p>Musicians use the following terms to discuss transposing instruments. - <em>sounding pitch</em> - The pitch that an instrument produces, regardless of its standard transposition. - <em>written pitch</em> - The pitch as written on the music. - <em>concert pitch</em> - The pitch at which the note name matches the standard frequencies for that pitch. (i.e. C = C, A = A, etc.) - In practical usage, concert pitch is almost always interchangeable with sounding pitch.</p><p>Transposing instruments are not conceptually difficult to understand–these instruments sound at a different pitch than written–but in practice, it often confuses students because instrument transposition is the process by which we <em>compensate</em> for an instrument’s sounding pitch. If we write for a B-flat instrument, it sounds a whole-step <em>lower</em>, so we must write the part a whole-step <em>higher</em> to get the performer to sound the correct pitch. Conversely, when reading a B-flat transposed part, we must read it a whole-step lower for concert pitch, because it is written a whole-step higher than sounding.</p><p>It is easy to transpose in the wrong direction when having to constantly flip back and forth between concert pitch and the transpositions, so it is important to have a complete understanding of transposition for each instrument. Luckily, they can be grouped into relatively few categories.</p><h2 id="ranges">Ranges</h2><p>First, it is helpful to discuss the standard ranges of the instruments while looking at the transpositions. If you can remember that a tenor saxophone has a range similar to a tenor voice, this makes it considerably easier to remember the direction and distance required for its transposition.</p><p>Instrument and voice ranges are self-explanatory, but there are a variety of caveats that affect the extremes for almost every instrument. Brass players and vocalists, for example, have a <em>wide</em> variation of how high or low an individual can comfortably perform depending on the experience of the performer. Some instruments can be physically altered such as the bassoon, double bass, and piano to add more range. Because of this variation as well as the constantly evolving standards of instrument construction and performance standards, you should always research an instrument before you choose to compose for it. While the internet is full of great resources–such as the link below–the best research for understanding an instrument is to discuss the instrument with expert performers. Even with good references such as the one below, it is not able to show the nuances of each instrument. (For example, this sheet does not show the common range extension techniques and tools such as the low C extension for double bass, the use of piccolo trumpet, or altissimo for woodwinds.)</p><h2 id="range-and-transposition-handout">Range and transposition handout</h2><p>For our part-writing, we will use the basic ranges from this helpful resource compiled by Dr. BJ Brooks.</p><p><a href="http://octatone.com/orchestral-ranges-transposition/">Orchestral Instrument Ranges and Transpositions</a></p><p>NOTE: There is a small mistake on the part for the double bass; the top note (D) is missing a tenor clef.</p><p>The ranges on this sheet are the <strong>written ranges</strong> for each of the instruments. If you want to find the sounding range, you will need to apply the transpositions that follow each staff. Read more about this below.</p><p>You may print this page for easy reference.</p><h2 id="clefs">Clefs</h2><p>While not directly related to transpositions, some instruments commonly read alternate clefs to lessen the number of ledger lines necessary. These include: - viola (default is alto clef, can switch to treble if necessary) - cello (default is bass clef, often switches to tenor (or even treble!)when necessary) - bassoon (default is bass clef, often switches to tenor when necessary) - French horn (default is treble clef, but occasionally can switch to any other clef if the part goes low enough into their pedal register) - trombone (default is bass clef, often switches to tenor when necessary)</p><h2 id="transposition">Transposition</h2><h4 id="terminology-confusion">Terminology confusion</h4><p>Before going further, please make sure that you understand the above definitions and usage for the terms <em>sounding</em> pitch, <em>concert</em> pitch, and <em>written</em> pitch.</p><p>One of the most confusing elements of understanding transposing instruments is the use of key names to describe the instruments. If an instrument is “in B-flat” as described above, that implies that the instrument reads parts that are written a M2 away from concert pitch. Unfortunately, this creates the possibility of confusing statements such as, “For a trumpet in B-flat, the key of A-flat is actually B-flat.” This ambiguity should be clarified by differentiating between the instrument’s transposition and the key signature in which the piece is composed: “For a trumpet [that sounds] in B-flat, the [concert key signature] of A-flat <a href="#major">major</a> is [written] as B-flat <a href="#major">major</a>.” The language we use in this instance is clunky at best, inadequate at worst. It falls upon the musician to make sure that they are communicating clearly when it comes to transposing instruments.</p><h4 id="non-transposing-instruments-in-c">Non-transposing instruments (in C)</h4><p>Non-transposing instruments are the easiest to understand, because they read and sound at the pitch written. This group includes: - voice - piano - violin - viola - cello - flute - oboe - bassoon - trombone (alto, tenor, and bass) - See the section below on the history of brass instruments for details. - euphonium/baritone - tuba - See the section below on the history of brass instruments for details. - harp</p><h4 id="octave-displacing-instruments">Octave displacing instruments</h4><p>Some instruments read in concert pitch, but sound in a different octave. This is done to limit the number of ledger lines necessary to write their parts. This group includes: - piccolo (sounds up an octave from written) - bass flute (sounds down an octave from written) - contrabassoon (sounds down an octave from written) - guitar (sounds down an octave from written) - double bass (sounds down an octave from written)</p><h4 id="instruments-written-in-b-flat">Instruments written in B-flat</h4><p>You can find the concert pitch for all B-flat instruments by transposing <em>down</em> a M2 from the the written pitch. <strong>This does not necessarily give you the correct octave</strong>–just the correct pitch–so you must then consider the distance and direction based on the specific instrument.</p><p>Instruments in B-flat include many of the most common “band” instruments. This group includes: - Clarinet in B-flat (sounds down a M2 from written) - Bass clarinet in B-flat (sounds down a M9–or a M2 plus an octave–from written) - Bass clarinet adds an extra octave below the standard B-flat transposition. All clarinets read from treble clef music, so when accounting for the extra octave that the bass clarinet adds, it is easiest to switch to bass clef when writing this instrument in concert pitch. - Trumpet in B-flat (sounds down a M2 from written) - See section below on the history of brass instruments for a discussion of other common trumpets and their usage. - Soprano saxophone (sounds down a M2 from written) - Tenor saxophone (sounds down a M9–or a M2 plus an octave–from written) - The lower voiced saxophones (tenor and baritone) add an extra octave below the standard transposition. All saxophones read from treble clef music, so to account for the extra octave when writing in concert pitch, it is easiest to switch to bass clef for this instrument.</p><p>Conveniently, no B-flat instruments sound higher than their written pitch, so for each of the above instruments, when reading their written parts, transpose <em>down</em> a M2 to find concert pitch, although you must add the additional octave for tenor saxophone.</p><p>When reading a concert pitch line, transpose <em>up</em> a M2 to write for a B-flat instrument. Do not forget the additional octave for bass clarinet and tenor saxophone.</p><h4 id="instruments-written-in-e-flat">Instruments written in E-flat</h4><p>You can find the concert pitch for all E-flat instruments by transposing <em>up</em> a m3 or <em>down</em> a M6 from than the written pitch. <strong>This does not necessarily give you the correct octave</strong>–just the correct pitch–so you must then consider the distance and direction based on the specific instrument.</p><p>This group includes: - Clarinet in E-flat (sounds up a m3 from written) - Alto saxophone (sounds down a M6 from written) - Baritone saxophone (sounds down a M13–or a M6 plus an octave–from written) - The lower voiced saxophones (tenor and baritone) add an extra octave below the standard transposition. All saxophones read from treble clef music, so to account for the extra octave when writing in concert pitch, it is easiest to switch to bass clef for this instrument.</p><p>When reading an E-flat clarinet part, transpose a m3 <em>up</em> to find concert pitch. When reading an alto or baritone saxophone part, transpose a M6 <em>down</em> to find concert pitch, although you must add the additional octave for baritone saxophone.</p><p>When reading a concert pitch line, transpose <em>down</em> a m3 to write for E-flat clarinet. When reading a concert pitch line, transpose <em>up</em> a M6 to write for alto or baritone saxophone. Do not forget to add an additional octave for baritone saxophone.</p><h4 id="instruments-written-in-f">Instruments written in F</h4><p>You can find the concert pitch for all F instruments by transposing <em>down</em> a P5 from the written pitch. Conveniently, this will give you the correct pitch <em>and</em> octave for both of these instruments.</p><p>Both of the “horns” are written in F. This includes: - English horn - French horn - See section below on the history of brass instruments for a discussion of the many keys in which hornists are required to perform. - Many modern hornists prefer to refer to French horn simply as “horn.”</p><p>When reading an an English horn or French horn part, transpose <em>down</em> a P5 to find concert pitch.</p><p>When reading a concert pitch line, transpose <em>up</em> a P5 to write for either English horn or French horn.</p><h4 id="other-transposing-instruments">Other transposing instruments</h4><p>Almost all instruments fall into the above categories, but there are two outliers.</p><p>Clarinet in A is the only instrument that has a standard transposition in A. (Trumpet and French horn parts are occasionally written in A as well. See the section below on the history of brass instruments for more details.) To find concert pitch from a part in A, transpose <em>down</em> a m3 from the written pitch. To write in this transposition, you should write <em>up</em> a m3 from concert pitch. Students often confuse these transpositional directions with the more common E-flat instruments, because they are opposites.</p><p>Alto flute is the only instrument that has a standard transposition in G. (French horn parts are occasionally written in G as well. See the section below on the history of brass instruments for more details.) To find concert pitch from a part in G, transpose <em>down</em> a P4 from the written pitch. To write in this transposition, you should write <em>up</em> a P5 from concert pitch. Students often confuse these transpositional directions with the more common F instruments, because they are exact opposites.</p><h3 id="a-brief-history-on-brass-instrument-writing">A brief history on brass instrument writing</h3><h5 id="high-brass">High brass</h5><p>Brass instrument transpositions often confuse students, because they evolved into their modern forms at a later date than many of the other instruments. This means that depending on the era in which a piece was composed, there are a wide variety of “keys” in which the part might be written.</p><p>Early versions of both of the high brass instruments, trumpet and French horn, could only play pitches from the natural overtone series of their instruments which meant that early versions of these instruments were not fully chromatic. To compensate, composers would write the part “in X,” in order to show the performer which “key” their instrument needed to be in to play the part. Simply put, the performer had to change instruments every time that they changed keys. The practice of writing various transpositions for these two instruments lasted throughout the 20th century–long after both of these instruments became fully chromatic through the addition of valves–because of competing standards in which key the instrument would be tuned.</p><p>Modern professional trumpeters and hornists are masters of transposition. They choose the instrument on which they will perform based on timbral characteristics of each instrument, regardless of the transposition chosen by the composer. Modern trumpeters commonly use instruments pitched in B-flat, C, D, E-flat, and A and sometimes even F and G. Modern horns are built to include the standard F “side” of the horn, but by pressing a valve down they can switch to a B-flat “side” on a double horn, or even an E-flat or F (up an octave) “side” on a triple horn. You will encounter all of these transpositions when reading scores. If you are writing a modern <em>band</em> piece, it is common practice to write the trumpet parts in B-flat and horn parts in F. If you are writing a modern orchestral piece, it is simplest to just write trumpet parts in C and horn parts in F. The performer will decide which instrument, although if you desire a specific trumpet (e.g. cornet, flugelhorn, piccolo trumpet, etc.), you should ask a professional which transposition will work best.</p><h5 id="low-brass">Low brass</h5><p>Luckily, all of the low brass instruments read in concert pitch, so writing for them is relatively simple. However, do not be confused when trombonists talk about their instrument as a B-flat instrument. The fundamental of the trombone is a concert B-flat, but it <em>always</em> reads from parts written in C. It is a non-transposing instrument.</p><p>The tuba often confuses students for the same reason. Tubists have a variety of tubas from which to choose, including instruments with fundamentals at B-flat, C, E-flat, and F. This does not change the key in which the tubists read; their parts should always be in concert pitch. Instead, they learn a new set of “fingerings” for each instrument.

Because this is primarily a tonal harmony course, we are briefly dipping into the study of counterpoint to introduce voice-leading in its simplest form. I highly encourage you to study counterpoint fully at a later time (if you have not already), because it will change for the better the the manner in which you listen to, study, and perform music.</p><p>To begin studying basic counterpoint, we need to establish the fundamental concepts of intervallic consonance, intervallic dissonance, and the types of contrapuntal motion.</p><h3 id="goals-for-this-topic-1">Goals for this topic</h3><p>From the following examples, determine: - which intervals are considered consonant and dissonant - which consonances are considered perfect and imperfect - what elements are necessary to create contrapuntal motion - a simple way to describe each of the four types of contrapuntal motion: parallel, contrary, static, and oblique</p><h4 id="consonant-and-dissonant-intervals">Consonant and dissonant intervals</h4><p>The next two examples show an example of each possible perfect and imperfect consonance.

The first thing to understand is that the terms <em>consonant</em> and <em>dissonant</em> are subjective terms that are determined within a style. In this case, a perfect 4th undermines the melodic structure of tonality because it implies a weak inversion. Complete understanding of this idea requires a deeper knowledge of counterpoint and implied harmony, so at this point, I ask that you file this away for us to discuss when we get to tonal implications and usage of second inversion chords in Unit 7.</p><h4 id="contrapuntal-motion">Contrapuntal motion</h4><p>At its most basic, classifying contrapuntal motion is fairly simple to understand. When we compare two melodic lines, there are five types of possible motion: - <strong>parallel</strong> - two lines that move in the same direction and have the same interval <em>size</em> - <strong>similar</strong> - both lines move in the same direction but have different interval sizes - <strong>contrary</strong> - two lines that move in opposite directions - <strong>oblique</strong> - one line stays the same and the other line moves in any direction - <strong>static</strong> - neither line moves - static motion supercedes parallel motion</p><p>Each of these types of motion compares the direction of each line (i.e. ascending and descending) and the size of the interval.</p><p><em>NOTE: The full descriptions below of each type of non-chord tone are from the online textbook, <a href="http://www.openmusictheory.com">Open Music Theory</a>, although each has been edited to suit this textbook’s terminology and purpose. If you have not had a chance to check out Open Music Theory in the Further Reading sections from the previous units, please take the time to do so. It is an excellent resource!</em></p><h3 id="chord-tones-versus-non-chord-tones-ncts">Chord tones versus non-chord tones (NCTs)</h3><p>To this point in our harmonic analyses, we have looked at mostly simple textures that utilized steady, blocked chords. To make music varied and interesting, however, we need to be able to create a variety of melodic shapes and motives, and this requires using a mixture of pitches that are functional–meaning that they are part of the harmony–and non-functional embellishments. We call these embellishing pitches <em>non-chord tones (NCT)</em>, and understanding which pitches are functional is often the most difficult hurdle in harmonic analysis.</p><p>Much like determining the harmonic rhythm, finding NCTs can be difficult because it requires you to work through all possible combinations of the pitches within a given harmony and then choose the most likely combination. Even if you know that the harmony spans only two beats, it can be difficult to sort through all the possible combinations if the texture is complicated. Fortunately, the same strategies that work for determining the harmonic rhythm provide a foundation for determining NCTs. You can begin by looking at melodic patterns and bass-lines, and it is helpful to consider whether a note occurs in a strong or weak metric position. It is unusual for the functional tones to occur <em>only</em> on offbeats, as the ear is drawn to pitches when they occur on the beat.</p><p>Even for one experienced in finding patterns within the music, this still sometimes requires trial-and-error. When first learning how to identify non-chord tones, you may want to copy and rearrange the pitches on another staff (or lightly next to the chord if there is room,) to see what triads and seventh chords are even possible given the present notes. Usually this is enough to limit the possibilities to one or two chords. When it is not, you will then need to refer to your harmonic flowchart to see if there is some context that could provide a probable chord.</p><h3 id="discussing-and-labeling-non-chord-tones">Discussing and labeling non-chord tones</h3><p>When developing a harmonic analysis, you should place parentheses around the note head of each non-chord tone and then label the NCT with its abbreviation. Each of the non-chord tones below will have a standard abbreviation written next to the definition. (For example, passing tones will be labeled using a “pt.”)</p><p>Although before we can find non-chord tones in music, we need a shared terminology that describes how they are constructed. There are a great variety of NCTs, but every type shares a basic framework that we classify by motion between the notes on either side of it. - the <em>preparation</em> - The chord tone that directly precedes the NCT. - Its relationship to the NCT will define the type of movement used to approach the NCT. - the <em>non-chord tone</em> - The NCT must not belong to the chord. This should be obvious given the name, but this is the most common mistake that students make when labeling NCTs. - the <em>resolution</em> - The chord tone that immediately follows the NCT. - Its relationship to the NCT will define the type of movement used to leave the NCT.</p><p>And while these three terms provide a framework through which we can classify the movement of all non-chord tones, there are other aspects of their function and characteristics that we may need to discuss. - Accented vs unaccented - An accented NCT occurs in a strong metric position (“on the beat”). - An unaccented NCT occurs in a weak metric position (“off the beat”). - On-chord vs off-chord - An on-chord NCT coincides with a change of harmony. - An off-chord NCT does not coincide with a change of harmony. - Chromatic vs diatonic - Diatonic NCTs use only the notes present in the key-signature whereas chromatic NCTs have an accidental. - As per usual, we will consider the leading tone in a minor key as diatonic. - All types of NCTs can be either chromatic or diatonic, although some are extremely rare (such as a chromatic suspension). - Ascending vs descending (<em>passing tones only</em>) - This describes the direction created by the passing tone when combined with the chord tones on either side. - Upper vs lower (<em>neighbor tones only</em>) - Neighbor tones can be divided into two categories based on whether they are above or below the chord tone that they are embellishing.</p><p>One note on these labels: Because some methods for musical analysis only focus on music of certain periods (e.g. the Classical era), they may be overly specific in describing certain non-chord tones in a way that does not fully address the nature of the non-chord tone. For example, some texts say that suspensions must be accented, but because accented refers to a metric position (‘on’ or ‘off’ the beat) rather than a harmonic position, this is not always true in later styles. This is likely always true in the music of Mozart or even Beethoven, but it is not always true for the music of Gustav Mahler or John Lennon. It would be better to say that suspensions are always <em>on-chord</em>, because this allows for a suspension to happen in a weaker metric position. Harmony and rhythm exist independently, so we should use labels that help us understand all types of tonal music.</p><h3 id="passing-tones-neighbor-tones-and-suspensions">Passing tones, neighbor tones, and suspensions</h3><p><strong>Analyze the following chorale.

The following descriptions are lightly edited versions taken from <em>Open Music Theory</em>.</p><h5 id="passing-tone-pt">Passing tone (pt)</h5><p><img src="images/embellishingTones/passingTone.png" /></p><p>A passing tone is a melodic embellishment that occurs between two stable tones, creating stepwise motion. <em>It is approached by stepwise motion and left by stepwise motion in the same direction.</em> A passing tone can be either accented or unaccented as well as on-chord or off-chord.</p><p>The typical figure is <em>chord tone – passing tone – chord tone</em>, filling in a third (see example), but multiple adjacent passing tones can also be used to fill in the space between two chord tones, and these would be labeled by their number as appropriate–<em>double passing tone (dpt), triple passing tone (tpt), or quadruple passing tone (qpt)</em>. The only time you can have a <em>diatonic</em> double passing tone is between the chordal fifth and root of a triad (e.g. sol-(la-ti)-do within a I chord). You can have a double passing tone to fill in a third if there are chromatic tones, and all triple and quadruple passing tones require chromatic pitches.</p><h5 id="neighbor-tone-nt">Neighbor tone (nt)</h5><p><img src="images/embellishingTones/neighborTone.png" /></p><p>Like the passing tone, a neighbor tone is a melodic embellishment that occurs between two stable tones; however, a neighbor tone occurs between two instances of the same stable tone. <em>It is approached by stepwise motion and left by stepwise motion in the opposite direction.</em> Also like the passing tone, movement from the stable tone to the neighbor tone and back will always be by step. A neighbor tone can be either accented or unaccented, but unaccented is more common. It can also be either on-chord or off-chord.</p><h5 id="suspension-sus">Suspension (sus)</h5><p><img src="images/embellishingTones/suspension.png" /></p><p>A suspension is formed of three critical parts: the <em>preparation</em> (accented or unaccented), the <em>suspension</em> itself (accented), and the <em>resolution</em> (unaccented). The preparation is a chord tone (consonance). The suspension is <em>the same note</em> as the preparation and <em>will always be on-chord</em>, <strong>which means that all suspensions require two chords</strong>, because the preparation will be on a different chord than the NCT itself. The suspension then resolves downward by step to the resolution, which occurs over the same harmony as the suspension.</p><p>Of note, it is a common misconception among students that a suspension is only present if you see a <em>tied</em> note. This is not true; the tone can be re-articulated. It only needs to follow the pattern of - chord tone -&gt; non-chord tone approached by static motion on a new chord -&gt; resolution within the same chord</p><p>The suspension is in many respects the opposite of an anticipation (see the next topic, Unit 9b); if the anticipation is an early arrival of a tone belonging to the following chord, a suspension is a lingering of a chord tone belonging to the previous chord that forces the late arrival of the new chord’s chord tone. However, in composition and improvisation, the suspension must be treated with a great deal more care than an anticipation. The most common suspensions (and their resolutions) in upper voices form the following intervallic patterns against the bass: 9–8, 7–6, 4–3. (With the exception of 9–8, the pitch class of the resolution tone should never sound in another voice simultaneous with the suspended tone.)</p><p>Because suspensions can take many forms, we apply intervallic labels. When the suspension is in an upper voice, we always label the intervals of the suspension and its resolution against the <em>bass</em> meaning that the intervals will move from large to small (e.g. 4-3, 7-6, 9-8, etc.). When a suspended note is in the bass voice, however, we label the intervals against the most dissonant interval which means that the intervals will move from small to large (e.g. 2-3). When you measure a downward resolution in an upper voice against a lower voice, the intervals get smaller as the upper voice moves <em>closer</em> to the bass. When you measure a downward resolution against a higher voice, the intervals get larger as the bass moves <em>away</em> from the upper voice.</p><p>Of note, because we use the most dissonant voice to label suspensions in the bass, you will use the “2-3” label in the vast majority of this type of suspension. These intervals will be present for suspensions resolving to either the root or chordal third as long as the chord is complete. You are unlikely to encounter a suspension above a chordal fifth in the bass because of the usage rules of second inversion chords, and a suspension above the chordal seventh would just be the root of the chord–meaning that it is not a non-chord tone.</p><p>The most common suspensions are the 4-3, 7-6, 9-8 (2-1), and 2-3 suspensions, but others can and do occur regularly.</p><h3 id="retardations-ret">Retardations (RET)</h3><p><strong>The next example has taken the framework above and incorporated a new NCT: <em>the retardation</em>.

It is almost always reserved for the final chord of a large formal division (or a movement), and it frequently appears simultaneously with a suspension (as seen in the picture above). Like suspensions, retardations must be accented and on-chord, yet unlike suspensions, it is not necessary to label the intervals against the bass, although you may do so if you wish.</p><h3 id="a-few-last-notes">A few last notes</h3><p>There are four other standard non-chord tones that we will discuss in the next topic, but we should clear up some common questions before moving on.</p><ol type="1"><li>First, some non-chord tones can occur within a single harmony <em>or</em> across two harmonies, meaning the preparation, NCT, and resolution are contained within one chord or spread across two. But other NCTs are restricted to one or the other. For example, a passing tone can be either within a single chord or spanning two chords, but suspensions and retardations can <em>only</em> happen across two chords; it is not possible to have suspension or retardation within a single chord. Any NCT with restrictions such as this will be noted in their descriptions, and it is imperative that you learn the context for each of the non-chord tones, so that you can quickly identify these issues.</li><li>Once we have discussed all nine of the standard NCTs, you will be able to describe and analyze almost any combination of melodic intervals as they pertain to tonal harmony. Generally speaking, if you cannot come up with an analysis of a melody that accounts for each NCT into one of the nine categories, that means that you likely analyzed the harmonies incorrectly. As with even the most consistent of musical ideas, there will be occasional exceptions, but understanding your NCTs will be one of the easiest ways for you to make your analyses more effecient and effective.</li><li>As we learn each of these non-chord tones, you will begin to notice these patterns in music, even when no NCT is present. If you would like to use a motion description for a chord tone, such as passing or neighbor, you can replace the word <em>tone</em> with the word <em>figure</em>. So a “passing figure” is a pitch that is approached by step and left by step in the same direction, but all three of the pitches that make up the preparation, passing tone, and resolution are chord tones.</li><li>One of the most common questions about non-chord tones is whether a pitch should be written as a passing tone or a chordal seventh. For example, in the progression below, we have an imperfect authentic cadence, that starts as a simple triad, but then the alto voice moves to <code>fa</code> which could be analyzed as either a passing tone or a chordal seventh. So which would you choose? Is this a V chord with a passing tone or is this a V<sup>7</sup> chord with no non-chord tones?</li></ol><ul><li>In this particular case, I would consider <code>fa</code> as part of the chord, because it is functioning as a chordal seventh. The chordal seventh is a tendency tone that typically resolves downward by step, and it is doing so here. If it resolved in another way (e.g. up by step), it might be a melodic passing tone and would therefore be not functional.</li></ul><p>{% capture ex4 %}X:4 T:V7 to I with ambiguous NCT M:4/4 L:1/2 Q:1/4=80 K:C V:1 [B/2G][B/2F][cE]|] V:2 clef=bass [G,,D][C,C]|] w:VorV7? I{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“4” abc=ex4 %}</p><p>Regardless of whether you include the pitch as functional, the NCTs must always match the Roman numeral. In this scenario, if you choose to include the chordal seventh in your harmony, you only need to write the proper Roman numeral and inversion figure. If, however, you decide that the chordal seventh is just a passing tone, you must label it as a non-chord tone and write only <code>V</code> for the Roman numeral.</p><h3 id="a-final-reminder">A final reminder!</h3><p>As we first begin to study non-chord tones, the most important thing to remember is what the name “non-chord tone” emphasizes. <strong>NCTs must not belong to the chord.</strong> This is one of the most common mistakes for beginning analysts.</p><h4 id="a-starting-place">A Starting Place</h4><p>In this course, we will be studying many styles of music, but all of these will have roots in the harmonic and melodic practices of the common practice period. The common practice period is generally considered to include Western art music from the Renaissance through the Romantic eras, but any music that that grew out of this tradition–including almost all popular music today–can be analyzed using the tools we will study for common practice harmony.</p><p>By the time musicians begin formally exploring music theory, they likely are familiar with basic music notation–treble and bass clefs, staves, ledger lines, and accidentals–due to time spent performing. If you are uncomfortable with any of aspect of these concepts, you can review by reading the explanations under the <em>Further Reading</em> section of <a href="01-pitches-clefs/a2-pitchesclefs.html">Discussion 1a</a>.</p><h3 id="clefs-1">Clefs</h3><p>Even though most college music students are familiar with reading music, most are partial to the clef associated with their primary instrument or voice-part. It is vital that musicians be fluent in not only the two most common clefs–treble and bass–but also with two additional clefs: alto clef and tenor clef. Alto and tenor clefs are often used by instruments such as viola, cello, trombone, and bassoon. They alleviate the use of ledger lines in the extreme registers of an instrument and appear regularly in even the most elementary music.</p><h4 id="exploring-clefs">Exploring clefs</h4><p>Treble clef is sometimes referred to as a <em>G-clef</em>, and bass clef can be called an <em>F-clef</em>. Alto and tenor clefs are known as <em>C-clefs</em>. So let’s piece together the notes and octave relationships between the clefs as well as why the clefs have these alternate names.</p><p>In the examples below: - the treble and alto clefs are in unison - the tenor and bass clefs are in unison - the treble/alto clefs are separated from the the tenor/bass clefs by one octave - middle C rests on the first ledger line below the treble clef staff</p><p>Knowing this, use these examples to find: - the order of pitch names for each clef’s lines and spaces. - why treble clef is a G-clef, why bass clef is an F-clef, and why alto and tenor clefs are C-clefs. - where middle C is on each clef. - any tips or tricks that may help in differentiating and reading clefs.</p><p>{% capture ex1 %}X: 1 T: Pitches and Clefs M: 4/4 L:1/4 K:C V:1 name=“Treble Clef” E A F B G ^C G,|] w: E A F B G C# G V:2 name=“Alto Clef” clef=“alto” E A F B G ^C G,|] w: E A F B G C# G V:3 name=“Tenor Clef” clef=“tenor” E, A, F, B, G, ^C, G,,|] w: E A F B G C# G V:4 name=“Bass Clef” clef=“bass” E, A, F, B, G, ^C, G,,|] w: E A F B G C# G{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“1” abc=ex1 %}</p><h4 id="conclusion-7">Conclusion</h4><p>Clefs have secondary names because each clef is centered around the pitch in its name. The bass clef’s dots surround an F, and the two C-clefs are centered on middle C. Treble clef, however, not only encircles the G at the center of its spiral, but it evolved from a stylized <em>G</em>. For a well-researched, short article on the evolution of clefs, I suggest reading Jimmy Stamp’s <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-evolution-of-the-treble-clef-87122373/">The Evolution of the Treble Clef</a> from the Smithsonian website.</p><p>The octave relationship for each clef is the most important thing you can remember from this discussion, and the easiest way to demonstrate this is to look at where middle C sits on each clef.

For example, you could memorize where C sits in each clef and count steps (letter names), or you could expand that concept to memorize how thirds are stacked to move around more quickly. While this is a reasonable method for familiarizing yourself with clefs, it will ultimately be too slow and inconsistent to be practical. - The final suggestion was to determine the visual relationship of your weaker clefs to your strongest clef, and then use this to read in the new clef. - For example, if you are primarily comfortable in treble-clef, you could remember that alto-clef moves all of the pitches down by a step relative to treble clef. (This ignores octave displacement, of course.) In this case, if you read alto clef as a treble clef but <em>up</em> a step, this compensates and gives you a quick visual method for reading the clef. - To demonstrate this method: if a note head is on the line where B would be in treble clef, you could “translate” that pitch into alto clef by moving up a step (or letter name) to find that it is C. - You would then need to find the visual relationships for each clef, because each will have a different visual distance and direction compared to your primary clef. - Like the relative note identification method above, this could be slow and inconsistent, but if one regularly transposes, this could be used effectively.</p><p>Thus far, we have focused on the building blocks for constructing music such as pitches, intervals, chords, and melodic interaction, but we have yet to look at how these elements combine to create harmony. To study harmony, we need a tool that describes chords and sonorities based on their function rather than their components.</p><p>To this point, we have used leadsheet notation to convey the essential components of a chord: root, bass note, quality, inversion, and any additional pitches.

The naturally-occurring VII chord is used <em>much</em> less and has a more limited scope in common practice.</li></ul></li><li>If there is an accidental in front of the Roman numeral, this affects only the root of the chord by raising or lowering it.<ul><li>The vii<sup>ø</sup> chord in minor does not require an accidental because it is assumed because of its diatonic function.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><em>Chordal third</em> - The case (i.e. upper-case versus lower-case) of the Roman numeral denotes the quality of the chordal third.</p><ul><li>All upper-case Roman numerals have a major third. This includes major triads, augmented triads, major major chords, and major minor chords.</li><li>All lower-case Roman numerals have a minor third. This includes all minor triads, diminished triads, minor minor chords, diminished minor chords, and diminished diminished chords.</li></ul></li><li><p><em>Chordal fifth</em> - The chordal fifth is altered by adding either a <sup>o</sup> (the diminished symbol) for lowered fifths or a <sup>+</sup> for raised fifths.</p></li><li><p><em>Chordal sevenths</em> - To show a chordal seventh is present, you only need to use an inversion figure that implies a seventh chord (i.e. <sup>7, 6/5, 4/3, or 4/2</sup>).</p><ul><li>A seventh chord inversion figure with no alteration implies a minor seventh above the root. It may be helpful to think of this as the “default” chordal seventh.<ul><li>Having a minor interval as default is different than chordal thirds and fifths, because both of those chord members have “defaults” of a major interval.</li><li>We do this for two reasons:<ul><li>We cannot raise a M7 above the root; it just becomes the root.</li><li>A d7 would be lowered <em>twice</em> if we used a M7 as default, and we would have to devise a new system for showing this.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>A <sup>M</sup> is added before the inversion figure for all major seventh chords, even though they do occur diatonically. This allows us to differentiate chord qualities clearly once secondary functions and mode mixture are introduced later in the course. Non-diatonic harmonies are common enough that the Roman numeral system must be able to clearly distinguish them while retaining its clarity.</li><li>The diminished symbol, <sup>o</sup>, is added before the inversion figure for fully diminished seventh chords. This also shows that the chordal fifth is lowered, the same as in a triad.<ul><li>If you think of a m7 above the root as the default chordal seventh for inversion figures, then adding <sup>o</sup> lowers the chordal seventh by a half step.</li><li>As you know, half diminished seventh chords (diminished minor chords) have a lowered fifth above the root but a <em>minor</em> seventh, rather than the diminished seventh of a fully diminished seventh chord. For half diminished chords, we replace the <sup>o</sup> with a <sup>ø</sup> to show that the chordal fifth is lowered but the chordal seventh is a m7 above the root.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Remember that when you add an inversion to a seventh chord, you do not need a <sup>7</sup> anymore. The inversion implies the seventh.</p><p>By having each part of a Roman numeral describe an isolated chord tone, we are able to accurately describe any chord that can occur in our tonal harmony system, regardless of whether it has a standard function.</p><table><colgroup><col style="width: 25%" /><col style="width: 25%" /><col style="width: 25%" /><col style="width: 25%" /></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th>Chordal member</th><th>Default implied pitch</th><th>To raise by semitone from default</th><th>To lower by semitone from default</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>root</td><td>diatonic scale degree</td><td>sharp symbol in front of Roman numeral*</td><td>flat symbol in front of Roman numeral*</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>third</td><td>based on case of Roman numeral</td><td>upper case (M3)</td><td>lower case (m3)</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>fifth</td><td>P5 above root</td><td><sup>+</sup> after Rom num</td><td><sup>o</sup> after Rom num</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>seventh</td><td>m7 above root</td><td><sup>M</sup> before inversion figure</td><td><sup>o</sup> before inversion figure**</td></tr></tbody></table><p>*For clarity’s sake, we <strong>always</strong> use a sharp or flat symbol to show that we are raising or lowering the root, even if you are actually adding a natural. When analyzing pieces that change keys–especially to distant keys–this makes it much easier to look for similar patterns, regardless of whether the key signature uses sharps or flats.</p><p>**Because the diminished symbol <sup>o</sup> implies the interval of a d5 AND a d7, you must use the half-diminished symbol if you wish to alter the fifth but leave the chordal seventh as a m7 above the root.</p><h4 id="add-and-sub">Add and sub</h4><p>There are two more possible additions for Roman numerals, but these are advanced techniques are will not be necessary until Unit 19. For completeness, we will discuss them here, but if you would rather skip this for now, please do so.</p><p>The word <sup>add</sup> is used when a tone is a functional part of the chord but does not belong to a standard triad or seventh chord. A good example of this would be a triad that has a functional 9th above the root. For example, in C major, if a C major triad were to have a D as necessary to the function of that chord, it would be labeled I<sup>add 9</sup>. This clearly identifies the triad plus the additional ninth, but it also omits the chordal seventh. If it <em>were</em> a major seventh chord, you would not need use the <sup>add</sup> function, because a 9 would imply everything below it. So a I<sup>M9</sup> is assumed to have 9th, 7th, 5th, and 3rd above the root.</p><p>The word <sup>sub</sup> is used when a tone <em>replaces</em> another chord tone. The replaced chord tone is always the closest chord tone below the subbed chord tone. For example, if the tonic triad in C major had a 4th above the root instead of the chordal third, you would label that as I<sup>sub4</sup>. This implies that the 4th replaces the chord tone directly below it, so this would be a triad with C, F, and G.</p><p>The simplest definition of music is “organized sound,” and we can use this definition as a launching point for discussing pitch collections and scales. If we accept that music is “organized sound,” then the method used to organize it will define the <em>style</em> of composition. For this course, we will study <em>tonal</em> music, because <em>tonal</em> describes the organizational method–or style–of this music.</p><h3 id="tonal-music">Tonal music</h3><p>Tonal music is organized around a central tone called the <em>tonic</em>.</p><p>And once we have a central pitch around which we build a tonality, every pitch in the tonality is defined by its relationship to that pitch. It is these intervallic relationships that differentiate one pitch collection from another, and we can categorize each pitch collection by studying their commonalities and differences.</p><p>In Unit 1, we defined moveable-do solfege as a way for us to look at the relationships between a group of pitches that are organized around a central pitch. In doing so, we created a <em>scale</em>, even though we didn’t define it as such. Whenever you group any number of pitches, you create a <em>collection</em>. However, when you order a collection by the frequency of each pitch–or more simply stated, how high or low the pitches are–you create a scale. So a scale is <em>a collection of pitches that are organized in an ascending or descending form</em>, and consequently create a fixed intervallic pattern. A scale can encompass any tuning system or style of composition.</p><p>Certain scales are at the core of all common practice harmony, and as a music student, you are likely already familiar with these: <em>major, minor, modal, pentatonic, and chromatic</em>. Below, we discuss the diatonic scales (i.e. major and minor) and Topic 2b details the others. We will explore some extended scales in Unit 22.</p><h4 id="diatonic-music">Diatonic music</h4><p>For the majority of this course, we will be discussing <em>diatonic</em> music, which is a subset of tonal music. The term <em>diatonic</em> can have a variety of meanings depending on context, but for this course, we will be using this term to refer to music that: - is built around a tonic pitch - includes all seven pitch names (i.e. letters) - creates harmonic tension and release using tonic and dominant harmonies (more on this in Unit 6)</p><p>Put simply, our musical hierarchy is:</p><ul><li><em>Music</em> - organized sound<ul><li><em>Tonal music</em> - music organized around a central pitch<ul><li><em>Diatonic music</em> - tonal music that uses all seven letter names only once and follows a specific order of intervals<ul><li><em>Diatonic scale</em> - a ascending (or descending) ordering of all seven pitches in a diatonic pitch collection, contained within one octave</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="goals-for-this-topic-3">Goals for this topic:</h3><p>As you listen through all of the examples below, you should: - describe the pattern that determines the pitches in the <em>major</em> scale and all forms of <em>minor</em> scales regardless of starting pitch - You can think of this question as how to describe the scale without using note names or solfege. - figure out why <em>natural, melodic,</em> and <em>harmonic</em> minors are named as they are - memorize the names for each scale degree (i.e. tonic) as well as the corresponding numeral notation - how the names for each scale degree are derived (e.g. How are dominant and subdominant scale degrees related?) - incorporate the Latin spelling for every solfege</p><h4 id="important-notes">Important notes</h4><p>The following examples demonstrate how the tune of <em>Happy Birthday</em> would be written if only using the notes from a particular scale.

All seven letters can be used once, and no letter can be used more than once. This creates a series of 2nds that create our scale.</p><p>Major scales have an intervallic pattern of:</p><p><em>(W = whole-step, H = half-step, A = augmented 2nd)</em></p><p>W - W - H - W - W - W - H</p><p>Natural minor scales have an intervallic pattern of:</p><p>W - H - W - W - H - W - W</p><p>Harmonic minor scales have an intervallic pattern of:</p><p>W - H - W - W - H - A - H</p><p>Melodic minor scales have both an ascending and descending form. The intervallic pattern for descending melodic minor is identical to a descending natural minor scale. (The necessity of this seemingly redundant pattern is discussed below under “Why we <em>need</em> three minor scales.”) The intervallic pattern for 4ascending melodic minor is:</p><p>W - H - W - W - W - W - H</p><h4 id="labeling-scale-degrees">Labeling scale degrees</h4><p>When discussing scales, it is helpful to have a method that refers to pitches without referencing a specific key. For example, the first “Happy Birthday” example on the previous page is written in G major, but there are eleven other tonics around which we could structure that melody’s intervallic structure. In order to reference the interval pattern rather than the actual pitches, we use <em>scale degrees</em>.</p><p>One common way to communicate pitches of the scale is to use scale degree numbers. We denote these by placing a caret <code>^</code> above the scale degree number. For example, the pitch that is a fifth above the tonic would be called fifth scale degree and would be written as <code>^5</code>, although the caret would be above the numeral, not to the side.</p><p>A second common way to describe scale degrees is to use <em>solfege syllables</em>. In this system, each scale degree is assigned a single-syllable Latin word, and this can be helpful when sight-singing. The chart below shows all seven base solfege syllables and how each can be altered for raised and lowered pitches. If a solfege symbol is marked as “N/A,” this alteration is non-functional in tonal harmony.</p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Scale degree</th><th>Solfege syllable</th><th>Raised</th><th>Lowered</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>^1</td><td>do</td><td>di</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>^2</td><td>re</td><td>ri</td><td>ra</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>^3</td><td>mi</td><td>N/A</td><td>me</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>^4</td><td>fa</td><td>fi</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>^5</td><td>sol</td><td>si</td><td>se</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>^6</td><td>la</td><td>li</td><td>le</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>^7</td><td>ti</td><td>N/A</td><td>te</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A final method for labeling scale degrees is to use the names of the functions of each pitch as it relates to tonic. These names evolved over centuries of theory treatises from scholars such as Rameau, Riemann, Secther, Schoenberg, and Schenker. We will not use these names often in this course, but knowing them can help understand harmonic function when that concept is introduced.</p><p>They are: 1. Tonic 2. Supertonic 3. Mediant 4. Subdominant 5. Dominant 6. Submediant 7. Leading-tone/Subtonic</p><p>Notice the relationship between any term and its counterpart as denoted by the prefix <code>sub</code>. The dominant is a fifth above the tonic; the subdominant is a fifth below the tonic. The mediant is a third above the tonic; the submediant is a third below the tonic.</p><p>The supertonic is a 2nd above the tonic, but because of the importance and function of the leading-tone, its scale degree name changes to reflect the difference between a major 2nd below the tonic versus the minor 2nd below the tonic. If the 2nd below the tonic is a whole-step, we call it the subtonic. If the 2nd below the tonic is a half-step, we call it the leading tone. This is true in both major and minor.</p><h4 id="tonal-centers-and-modes">Tonal centers and modes</h4><p>We consider a key to be defined by its tonic, so if two scales share a tonic, they are considered to be the same key but different <em>modes</em> of each other. For example, G major and G minor are the same key, but different modes. This is confusing for many students, because they have always associated their concept of a key with its key signature.</p><h4 id="why-we-need-three-minor-scales">Why we need three minor scales</h4><p>Most intermediate music students learn various forms of the minor scale, but they do not often give much thought as to why.</p><p>Natural minor is the most obvious. It uses all of the naturally occurring notes from the key signature.</p><p>We will discuss the role of harmonic minor more when we begin analyzing chords, but as the name implies, it is a form of minor that emphasizes the most common scale degrees from a harmonic standpoint.</p><p>The “Happy Birthday” examples above are perfect for exploring the importance of melodic minor. By keeping the interval sizes from “Happy Birthday” but changing the pitches to fit the various forms of minor, you can hear three similar but distinct versions of “Happy Birthday.” When a student first listens to the natural minor version, they often feel that the first <code>te</code> does not work with the rest of the tune, and in the harmonic minor version, the augmented 2nd that occurs between <code>ti</code> and <code>le</code> is jarring. On the other hand, the melodic minor version sounds entirely correct (although some may not like the darker tone of a traditionally “happy” song.)</p><p>This easily highlights the role of melodic minor – to create melodies in minor. By having both an ascending and descending version, we can resolve the sixth and seventh scale degrees upward and downward by relying on the tendency of those scale degrees. <code>Te</code> and <code>le</code> both have a strong downward pull and almost always resolve downward. <code>Ti</code> and <code>la</code> both have a strong upward pull and tend to resolve upward. These are general rules and are occasionally broken, but I encourage you to play with the example below to hear how “strange” the piece becomes if you do not allow the sixth and seventh scale degrees to account for their resolutions. (Try putting <code>la</code> in for every sixth scale degree for the most obviously jarring version.)</p><p>{% capture ex8 %}X:8 %%staffsep 100% T:Happy Birthday in G melodic minor T:using the parallel minor to G major M:3/4 L:1/4 Q:1/4=90 K:Bb D/2&gt;D/2| E D G| ^F2 D/2&gt;D/2| E D A| G2 D/2&gt;D/2| w:^5 ^5 ^6 ^5 ^1 ^#7 ^5 ^5 ^6 ^5 ^2 ^1 ^5 ^5 w:sol sol le sol do ti sol sol le sol re do sol sol d B G| F HE c/2&gt;c/2| B G A/4D/4=E/4^F/4| G2|] w:^5 ^3 ^1 ^7 ^6 ^4 ^4 ^3 ^1 ^2 ^5 ^#6 ^#7 ^1 w:sol me do te le fa fa me do re sol la ti do{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“8” abc=ex8 %}</p><p>This text assumes that you are already familiar with the basics of rhythmic notation, so we will be skipping most of the basic rhythmic terminology.

At its most basic, rhythmic notation tells us when a sound or silence starts and ends, but musical rhythmic notation tries, and mostly succeeds, to show higher levels of organization to make understanding the groupings within the music more understandable to the musician.</p><p>First, a few basic terms: <em>Meter</em> is the manner in which we organize strong and weak pulses in music over time, and it is from this grouping that we determine the length of each <em>measure</em>. Western music typically uses a <em>time signature</em>–represented at the beginning of the music as two stacked arabic numbers–as a shorthand to quickly convey the meter to a trained musician. At its most basic, time signatures tell us two things: - how we divide the meter into regular or irregular pulses called <em>beats</em> - how many of these <em>beats</em> are in the measure</p><p>If we imagine meter as a hierarchy, the <em>measure</em> is the top level and <em>beats</em> are how we divide the measure.

When asked to identify what all simple meters have in common, students often focus on the visual or mathematical representation of the time signature–for example, “The top number of the time signature is divisible by two.” Not only is this not true for all simple meters (e.g. 3/4 or 5/4) as shown in Examples 4a, it still would not differentiate this class of meters from compound meters. 6/8 and 12/8 are both compound time signatures that have a top number that is divisible by two.</p><p>The common characteristic of all simple meters is how the beat is divided. <em>Simple meters are any regular meter in which the beat is divided into two equal parts.</em></p><h4 id="duple-triple-and-quadruple">Duple, Triple, and Quadruple</h4><p>When looking at the above examples, simple meters can be divided into collections of duple, triple, and quadruple meters: - simple duple meter: 2 - ex: 2/4, 2/2, 2/8, 2/16 - simple triple meter: 3 - ex: 3/4, 3/2, 3/8, 3/16 - simple quadruple meter: 4 - ex: 4/4, 4/2, 4/8, 4/16</p><p>While this is correct for the meters above, it does not provide a definition of what these numbers mean. <em>These words–simple, triple, quadruple, and so on–are used to signify how many beats are in a measure.</em></p><h4 id="simple-time-signatures">Simple time signatures</h4><p>Most students correctly identify the function of the top and bottom numbers of the simple time signatures (but struggle with the same concept for compound meters).</p><p>For simple meter time signatures: - the top number represents the number of beats in the measure - the bottom number denotes the rhythmic value of the beat - if a 4 is on the bottom, the beat is represented by a quarter note - if an 8 is on the bottom, the beat is represented by an eighth note</p><p>To easily figure out the bottom number’s rhythmic value, I tell students to imagine that the bottom note becomes the denominator (lower number) of a fraction under a numerator of 1. A bottom number of 4 becomes 1/4–a quarter. A bottom number of 2 becomes 1/2–a half.</p><h4 id="beat-counting-system-in-simple-meters">Beat-counting system in simple meters</h4><p>It seems that for every unique syllable, there is a beat-counting system for affixing syllables to beats, divisions, and subdivisions. Each of these have their strengths and weaknesses, but for this theory course, we will be using the following for simple meters: - <code>beat numbers</code> for each beat (e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc.) - <code>&amp;</code> for the division (e.g. 1-&amp; 2-&amp; etc.) - <code>e</code> (pronounced ‘ee’) and a (pronounced ‘ah’) for the first level subdivisions (e.g. 1-e-&amp;-a 2-e-&amp;-a)</p><p>While this system can blend together aurally if said quickly, its primary benefit is that it has a unique syllable for each level through the first subdivision, and this makes communicating easier with higher specificity. For example, it is specific to ask, “Is the G4 on the ‘e’ of beat four a non-chord tone?” and this does not require further information.</p><h4 id="theoretically-ideal-rhythmic-notation-versus-common-practice">Theoretically ideal rhythmic notation versus common practice</h4><p>The two examples above demonstrate something I term “theoretically ideal” rhythmic notation versus two counterparts of the same rhythm beamed in a more commonly used manner. For these: - <em>Theoretically ideal</em> rhythmic notation never hides a beat under a note length longer than the beat, and instead uses tied notes to represent longer note values. - There are many common exceptions, most notably half notes and whole notes in relatively short measures, but this depends on the meter and context. - Theoretically ideal <em>beaming</em> applies to any note length that can be connected by beams–eighth notes, sixteenth notes, and further subdivisions.</p><p>This is very much inline with with this text’s general intention. Well-engraved music is meant to look pleasing, but it also should be easy for a performer to read. This often leads to grouping rhythmic patterns according to non-rhythmic ideas: lyrics, spacing measures across the page, phrasing, a limited number of systems, etc. <em>Theoretically ideal</em> rhythmic notation would never obscure a beat in order to provide the easiest reading of harmony within a score. Of course, no musician will ever use this in its strictest form because it would become difficult to read in many situations; imagine not using a whole note in 4/4 time and instead using four tied quarter notes.</p><p>That being said, it is important for students of music to begin trying to understand how grouping and beaming decisions are made, because in harmonic analysis, it is easy to sometimes miss voices because of obscured beats. It is also an excellent thought exercise to help students begin demonstrating mastery of meters and rhythmic values.</p><p>In music, a sequence occurs when a musical pattern is established then repeated at various transpositions. Sequences can be any combination of the following categories: - melodic, harmonic, or both - ascending or descending - diatonic or chromatic - single or multiple parts within each repeated segment</p><p>Sequences work because they rely on one of the most fundamental human characteristics: our ability to identify patterns. All music relies on a listener’s familiarity with the tendencies within a style, but these tendencies can be broken if a composer is able to create a new pattern to guide the listener. Once a musical pattern is established, it will sound “right” to a listener, even if this pattern defies standard tonal conventions.</p><h3 id="terminology-of-a-sequence">Terminology of a sequence</h3><p>For our discussions, we must differentiate between the overall pattern of the sequence and the individual segments within the sequence. We will use the term <em>sequence</em> to refer the whole, but we will use the word <em>iteration</em> to discuss an individual segment within the sequence. You can think of the iteration as one complete “building block” that is transposed repeatedly to create the sequence.</p><h3 id="melodic-sequences">Melodic sequences</h3><p>We will begin studying sequences by looking at melodic sequences because they demonstrate the basic principles without the complications of multiple voices. Look at the following melodic patterns; each one contains a few iterations at the beginning of a melodic sequence. Complete the pattern through the designated ending pitch and then discuss the repetition using the following terms: - ascending or descending - diatonic or chromatic - intervals of transposition - length of pattern - single or multiple parts within each repetition</p><p>Of note, when describing melodic sequences to another person, you can assume that the reader is looking at the music and therefore can see the entire first iteration. This means that you should not have to describe pattern of the iteration. Instead, we focus our description on <em>how the pattern is transposed</em>, not on describing the intervals within the <em>initial</em> segment.</p><p>{% capture ex1 %}X:1 T:Melodic sequences M:2/2 L:1/8 Q:1/4=70 K:C CDEC DEFD| x8| x8| x4c4|| cBcG BABF| AGAE x4| x8| x4C4|| cBcG B<sup>AB</sup>F| _BA_BF x4| x4G4|| c’gae fcdA| x6C2|| c’bc’g a^gae| fefc x4| x8| x4C4|| cBcG AGAE| dcdA BABF| x8| x8| g8||{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“1” abc=ex1 %}</p><h4 id="conclusions-20">Conclusions</h4><p>The terminology for describing sequences should be familiar because each term is used in a similar manner across all aspects of music, however, each term has some specific connotations when applied to sequences. - Ascending or descending describe the direction of the transpositions, not necessarily each interval within the pattern. - The interval(s) of transposition are most easily found by looking at the relationship between the first pitch of each iteration. Remember that as long as you know the starting pitch, you can extract all of the intervals within an iteration by using the intervals from the <em>first</em> iteration. - The length of the sequence should be obvious simply by looking at the music, however, so it is more helpful to focus on the length of the iterations. You should use the smallest common identifier for one iteration.For example, if the first iteration lasts an entire measure or more, you will describe it using a number of measures (e.g. one measures, two measures, etc.), but if a single iteration does not last a full measure, you will describe it by the number of beats it lasts. - Some iterations may have multiple parts, so you will need to look closely at the entire pattern to make sure that you do not have more than one transposition. For example, if your pattern is transposed down by a third then up by second, you will need to describe both parts in your description.</p><p>The discussion of chromatic and diatonic sequences, however, requires clarification. - A true <strong>diatonic pattern</strong> only uses notes within the key signature so they do not require a quality when discussing the transposition. For example, it is incorrect to describe a diatonic pattern using, “The pattern repeats in ascending <em>major</em> 3rds,” because diatonic patterns will have a mix of major 3rds and minor 3rds depending on which scale degree the iteration starts. Instead, we would say, “The pattern is transposed in diatonic ascending 3rds,” because this tells the reader to go up a 3rd and use whatever note is in the key signature. - Conversely, <strong>chromatic patterns</strong> <em>do</em> require a quality on the transposition for the interval, because the pattern repeats <em>exactly</em> using the same intervals from the initial iteration. If we isolate the third sequence from the melodic examples (see example below), we have a fixed intervallic pattern – in this case, descending m2, ascending m2, descending P4 – that is then repeated by transposing that <em>exact intervallic pattern</em> down a m2. In short, a chromatic pattern is assumed to transpose every part of the pattern exactly at a fixed interval(s) unless otherwise noted.</p><p>{% capture ex10 %}X:10 T:Strict chromatic sequence M:2/2 L:1/8 Q:1/4=70 K:C cBcG B<sup>AB</sup>F| _BA_BF A^GAE| _AG_A_E G4||{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“10” abc=ex10 %}</p><p>The fifth example above is the most difficult to complete and classify, because it mixes elements from both diatonic and chromatic sequences. It has a diatonic transposition, but each iteration can only be defined by a fixed intervallic structure. So we would describe this as a diatonic sequence that descends in 3rds, while each iteration is four pitches with the intervals of descending m2, ascending m2, and descending P4. Notice that the interval of transposition is found by comparing the first pitches of each iteration, <em>not</em> the interval between the last pitch of an iteration to the first pitch of the next iteration.</p><p>{% capture ex11 %}X:11 T:Diatonic transposition with a chromatic pattern M:2/2 L:1/8 Q:1/4=70 K:C c’bc’g a^gae| fefc d^cdA| B<sup>AB</sup>F G^FGD| E^DEB, C4||{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“11” abc=ex11 %}</p><h3 id="harmonic-sequences">Harmonic sequences</h3><p>Sequences occur harmonically as well, and when they do, they can supplant standard function or inversion conventions.

The first bar establishes tonic, and then a sequence begins in the second measure. After listening to it, discuss with your classmates whether it <em>sounds</em> functional.

Listen to the next example which stacks diatonic 5ths–meaning 5ths that reflect the key signature used for this tonal center–to create a series of perfect 5ths. As you listen, you will probably hear each of these dyads as having an “open” or “undefined” sound.

And in doing so, you created the basic harmonic structure for all diatonic music: <em>the triad</em>.</p><h3 id="building-diatonic-triads">Building diatonic triads</h3><p>All diatonic triads have exactly three pitches, although chordal members may be doubled and certain chord members can occasionally be omitted (and therefore implied) depending on the context. We name the chord members by the distance above the bottom pitch <strong>when the chord is stacked in thirds</strong>: - the lowest pitch is called the <em>root</em> of the chord - the pitch that is a 3rd above the root is called the <em>chordal third</em> - the pitch that is a 5th above the root is called the <em>chordal fifth</em></p><p>This can be confusing to beginning theory students, because we refer to intervals, scale degrees, and chordal members using the same ordinal numbers–thirds, fifths, etc.–and most often do not use the word “chordal.” As you become more experienced in describing these things, you will be able to discern the meaning from context, but if you would like to avoid confusion for now, you can preface the ordinal number with the word “chordal” until you are comfortable.</p><h4 id="a-note-on-terminology">A note on terminology</h4><p>As dyads have two pitches, the word “triad” implies <em>any</em> collection of three pitches.

To begin, you may classify triadic qualities by dividing them into two groups based on the defining chord members of the triads.</p><p>When looking at a diatonic triad in root position: - If the chordal fifth is either a diminished or augmented fifth, then the triad is labeled as <em>diminished</em> or <em>augmented</em> respectively. - Diminished triads always have a minor 3rd between the root and chordal third. - Augmented triads always have a major 3rd between the root and chordal third. - If the chordal fifth is a perfect fifth, the chordal third determines whether a triad is <em>major</em> or <em>minor</em>. - Major triads have a M3 above the root. - Minor triads have a m3 above the root.</p><p>From this, we can create a couple of simple groupings based on the chord members: - Between root and chordal 3rd - Augmented and major triads always have a M3 (or inversion) - Minor and diminished triads always have a m3 (or inversion) - Between root and chordal fifth - Major and minor triads always have P5 (or inversion) - Diminished triads always have a d5 (or inversion) - Augmented triads always have an A5 (or inversion)</p><p>Therefore, if a triad is in root position, you can determine triad qualities by the measuring the intervals of the stacked thirds.</p><ul><li>Major: M3 + m3</li><li>Minor: m3 + M3</li><li>Diminished: m3 + m3</li><li>Augmented: M3 + M3</li></ul><h3 id="triad-inversions-and-their-labels">Triad inversions and their labels</h3><p>Because triads have three pitches, there are three possible configurations that depend on which note of the triad is in the lowest voice. We will call these <em>inversions</em>, but they are sometimes referred to as <em>positions</em>. The system that we use to label inversions relies on the intervals within the triad.</p><p>Using the next example, you should: - determine the naming conventions of inversions - know the shorthand method for labeling inversions - develop a method for determining the chord quality of a triad that is not presented in root position (stacked as two thirds on top of each other.) - find the rest of the interval <em>sizes</em> between chord members of a triad (Hint: This may involve moving some chord members up or down an octave) - thirds (2) - fourth (1) - fifth (1) - sixths (2) - relate these interval sizes to our system for labeling triad inversions - provide inversion figures for root position, first-inversion, and second-inversion triads</p><p>NOTE: Because ABC notation is not capable of using superscript, the inversion figures in the next example are notated as fractions. If you were to write these by hand or use music notation software, you would notate all inversion figures in superscript as stacked numbers without a dividing line.

The simplest method for finding the root for any triad is to re-arrange the pitches until you have a triad that is stacked using only thirds. To be clear, this means no fourths, no sixths, and everything within a octave. You can even eliminate any duplicate pitches. Once you have this simplified arrangement of pitches, you can easily determine the root and quality of the chord using the method above.</p><p>For inversions, it is not necessary to know each interval within a triad, but instead, you only need to identify the chordal member in the bass.</p><ul><li>Root position: 5/3<ul><li>the root of the chord is in the bass</li><li>The <code>5</code> and <code>3</code> refer to the simple intervals above the bass</li></ul></li><li>First inversion: 6/3 (shortened to 6)<ul><li>the 3rd of the chord is in the bass</li><li>The <code>6</code> and <code>3</code> refer to the simple intervals above the bass</li></ul></li><li>Second inversion: 6/4<ul><li>the 5th of the chord is in the bass- The <code>6</code> and <code>4</code> refer to the simple intervals above the bass</li></ul></li></ul><p>Of note, there are six different possible intervals in a triad, depending on the inversion: two thirds, two sixths, one fourth, and one fifth. These intervals always exist between the same two chord members. - The thirds exist between the root/third and third/fifth. - The sixths appear when you invert either of the thirds, so between the third/root and fifth/third. - The fifth always exists between root/fifth. - The fourth is the inversion of the fifth, so between fifth/root.</p><h4 id="triad-voicings">Triad voicings</h4><p>Now that you understand the basic of triads and their inversions, we have to account for the variety of ways that they appear in music. When analyzing music, you must account for doubled pitches, implied harmonies, and a variety of spacings across the range of the performers; all of which can make it difficult to find the basic structure of the triad when looking at a musical score.</p><p>We will start by dealing with the issue of spacing, and to do so we must understand how the <em>inversion</em> interacts with the chord’s <em>voicing</em>.</p><p>Look at the following example, and compare the closed and open voicings listed there. You should: - be able to succinctly describe the differences - create a process to convert any inverted and/or open-voiced triad into a root-position triad in closed voicing</p><p>{% capture ex5 %}X:5 T:Triad voicings M:2/4 L:1/2 K:C V:1 “Closed”z| “Closed”[_BF]| “Open”[_Bf]| “Open”[fdF]| V:2 clef=bass [_B,,D,F,_B,]| [D]| [_B,,D]| [F,_B,]|{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“5” abc=ex5 %}</p><h4 id="conclusions-24">Conclusions</h4><p>As students develop the process for finding any inversion, they usually work through the following ideas: - Attempt #1: Open voicing is spread out. - True, but this is a subjective measure. What constitutes “spread out?” - Attempt #2: Closed voicings use only simple intervals and open positions have compound intervals. - This is interesting in that it works if the chord only has no repeated pitches, but does not hold up if a chord has repeated notes or more than four distinct pitches. - Attempt #3: - Closed voicings contain all chord members within one octave. - This is almost there , but does not explain how a chord with more than four pitches can be in closed position. - Attempt #4: Open voicing skips one of the voices. - This definition is almost there, but the term “voices” is problematic because “voices” does not relate directly to a chord.</p><p>A complete definition combines these ideas. - Closed voicing stacks all pitches of a chord in an ascending order and does not skip a chordal member. - Open voicings can have chord members stacked in any order and skip chord members. - All open voicings will cover more than one octave because of this.</p><h4 id="root-versus-bass"><em>Root</em> versus <em>bass</em></h4><p>Understanding the difference between the terms <em>root</em> and <em>bass</em> is the last piece of information necessary to find the quality of any chord; students often confuse the two. The term <em>bass</em> <strong>always</strong> refers to the lowest voice of any chord. The <em>root</em> is the lowest member of the chord <strong>if the chord is in root position</strong>, meaning that the triad is stacked as two thirds. If a chord is in root position, the <em>root</em> and <em>bass</em> will be the same pitch, however if a triad is in first or second inversion, the <em>root</em> and <em>bass</em> will be different pitches.</p><h4 id="finding-a-chord-quality-while-inverted">Finding a chord quality while inverted</h4><p>Combining a knowledge of inversions and voicings is critical in correctly identifying chord qualities. Teachers often suggest to students that they can find chord qualities by putting a chord in root position, but a chord in root position can be spread across multiple staves and still difficult to parse. We really mean that they should put the chord in root position <em>and</em> closed voicing. This allows the student to look at the interval qualities and determine the quality of the triad based on their knowledge of triadic interval structures.</p><p>I also suggest that you look at the method for identifying triads from the <em>Open Music Theory</em>. You can find this listed under the <a href="03-triads-7chords-leadsheet//a2-triads.html">Further Reading</a> for this topic.</p><p>Before we move on to fully analyzing harmonic function, we must define the stylistic rules of the music we will be studying. If you remember from our discussion of laws, rules, and strategies, rules are necessary to create a style. They are the binding agents that create a genre, but they also provide enough flexibility for composers within a style to carve out a unique voice.</p><p>For our beginning exploration of tonal harmony, we will be studying basic diatonic harmony in a chorale style. We will use this not because it is “superior” to any other style, but because it is relatively straightforward in its approach when compared to styles of music that came later. There are countless styles of tonal music that have evolved over the last four centuries, but a chorale style gives us the best starting place to study this evolution. So as we progress through rules that might seem outdated, do not lose sight of the <em>process</em> that we are creating. If you understand why each decision is made in this style, you will be able to intuit the next leap forward. And as we add complexity, you will eventually be able to apply these principles to <em>any</em> style of tonal music, even those that do not employ the underpinnings of tonic-dominant relationships.</p><h3 id="voice-leading-errors">Voice-leading errors</h3><p><strong>In the following example, each staff system highlights a different voicing error.</strong> - Compare the “good” chords to the “bad” chords to come up with descriptions of the first two basic voicing rules of <em>doubling</em> and <em>spacing</em>. - Because <em>range</em> is a simple maximum and minimum, I have listed conservative estimates for each voice part. - These can vary widely depending on the skill level of the intended performers but will be sufficient for our early exercises in part-writing.</p><p>{% capture ex1 %}X:1 %%staffsep75%% T:Voicing four-part harmony M:2/4 L:1/2 Q:1/4=80 K:C V:1 “#1-Doubling”[cE] [GE] [eE] [cE]|| [_BE] [cE] [_BE] [_BE] [_BE]|] “#2-Spacing”[cE] “(Range is ignored for this”[cE] “example)”[c’E] [c’e] [c’e]|] “#3-Conservative Ranges”[Cg]| [G,d]| x| x|] w:soprano alto V:2 clef=bass [C,G,] [C,G,] [C,G,] [C,C]|| [C,G,] [C,_B,] [C,E,] [C,_B,] [G,,G,]|] w:Good Good Bad Good Good Good Bad Bad Bad [C,G,] [C,,G,] [C,G,] [C,G,] [C,G]|] w:Good Good Bad Bad Good x| x| [GC,]| [DE,,]|] w:tenor bass{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“1” abc=ex1 %}</p><h4 id="conclusions-25">Conclusions</h4><p>To this point, everything that we have discussed has been based on a two-voice model, but to move into full diatonic harmony, we need to add inner voices and fully flesh out the harmonies. When doing this, there are certain rules that create better voice-leading and voicings when followed, but as with all stylistic guidelines, please note that these rules are generally strong suggestions rather than hard and fast rules. Good composers bend or break these rules if it better serves their ideas.</p><h5 id="doubling">Doubling</h5><p>When voicing triads in four-part harmony, at least one note must be doubled.</p><ol type="1"><li>Doubling the root is usually the ideal choice.</li><li>Doubling the fifth is the second best option.</li><li>Doubling the third is generally <em>unacceptable</em>, although there are certain corner cases in which this can be necessary. As a rule of thumb, do not double the third unless you are working on a chord in which you’ve already been told that doubling the third is the best option.</li><li>If you need to omit a voice, the fifth is the only option, because the root and third are required to define the chord. Diminished triads are the only diatonic harmony which functionally benefit from a fifth, but even in these situations, the fifth might be the best omission if necessary.</li><li>You can triple the root if necessary, but this voicing lacks the depth of a chord with a fifth and can create a difficult voicing to continue writing afterwards. This is most commonly used as an ending chord of the piece (often after a V7).</li></ol><p>Doubling in a seventh chord is similar, but because you have four notes for four voices, there is less freedom. 1. There must always be a root, third, and seventh in the chord, because without any of them, the chord is no longer a functional seventh chord. 2. If necessary, you can omit the fifth. 3. If the fifth is ommitted, the root is the only chord tone that can be doubled. Do not double the third or the seventh.</p><h5 id="spacing">Spacing</h5><p>Spacing is relatively straightfoward, but it can be difficult to create consistent rules based on the examples. Your final conclusions should be: - The bass <em>can</em> be as far from the tenor as needed. - Between the soprano, alto, and tenor voices, adjacent voices cannot be more than an octave apart. Meaning that the: - Tenor and alto <em>cannot</em> have more than an octave between them. - Soprano and alto <em>cannot</em> have more than an octave between them. - Tenor and soprano <em>can</em> have more than an octave between them. - When the tenor and soprano are within an octave of each other, we call this a <em>closed voicing</em>. - When the tenor and soprano are more than an octave apart, we call this an <em>open voicing</em>.</p><p>In general, a good voicing will mimic the overtone series on which our harmony is created. This details of this concept are discussed in Unit 11, but a general rule of good voicing is to use wider intervals between lower voices and narrower intervals between high voices.</p><h5 id="range">Range</h5><p>The ranges for each voice in the examples are conservative, but will serve us well in our beginning part-writing. These are highly dependent on the intended performers.</p><h5 id="voice-crossing">Voice-crossing</h5><p>There was no easy way to notate this in the examples, but you should avoid crossing your voices unless absolutely necessary. It is almost never absolutely necessary and often creates voice-leading and range issues. As you grow in your part-writing, you may find an occasional reason to cross voices, but do not unnecessarily complicate your first attempts.</p><p>Egon explained this best in one of the greatest 80’s movies, so bonus points for anyone that understands this reference. <img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/4ac0c9272c14cddd23e64831c6f7ae1e/tumblr_n2snvjtemt1r9a32bo1_400.gifv" alt="Never cross the streams" /></p><h2 id="class-discussion-1">Class discussion</h2><ul><li>Cadences are like the many different endings to a scentence or speech puncuation.</li><li>It’s not about if we can lable chords, but can we lable function.</li><li>Tonic is stable, Dominant is less stable as it feels like it eventually needs to resolve to <strong>I</strong>.

- DC: <strong>V</strong> to <strong>vi</strong>. The bass has <em>sol</em> and <em>la</em>. It you take away the <em>la</em> you end up with a PAC.

A cadence is at once a harmonic, melodic, rhythmic, and formal event, but cadences tend to be grouped according to different ways in which harmony and melody articulate that point of arrival.</p><h4 id="authentic-and-half-cadences">Authentic and half cadences</h4><p>These unit-ending points of arrival are first grouped into <em>authentic cadences</em> and <em>half cadences</em>. An authentic cadence occurs when a formal unit ends with the progression <strong>D5–T1</strong> (<strong>V<sup>(7)</sup>–I</strong>, <em>sol</em> to <em>do</em> in the bass voice). If the melody accompanying this harmonic progression arrives on <em>do</em>, it is called a <em>perfect authentic cadence</em>; it the melody ends on <em>mi</em> or <em>me</em> (or more rarely <em>sol</em>), it is called an <em>imperfect authentic cadence</em>.</p><p>Phrases that end on <strong>V</strong> without progressing to <strong>I</strong> are called <em>half cadences</em>. These cadences typically contain <em>re</em> in the melody, though <em>ti</em> and <em>sol</em> are also possible points of melodic arrival. The <strong>V</strong> is almost invariably a triad, rather than a seventh chord, and it is always in root position (<strong>D5</strong>).</p><p>Differentiating between <em>perfect authentic cadences</em> (PAC), <em>imperfect authentic cadences</em> (IAC), and <em>half cadences</em> (HC) by ear and with a score is essential both to formal analysis and model composition.</p><h4 id="simple-compound-and-double-cadences">Simple, compound, and double cadences</h4><p>Writers of Italian keyboard treatises like <a href="http://faculty-web.at.northwestern.edu/music/gjerdingen/partimenti/collections/Furno/regoleP5.htm">Furno</a> and <a href="http://faculty-web.at.northwestern.edu/music/gjerdingen/partimenti/collections/Fenaroli/Regole/regoleP3.htm">Fenaroli</a> (and, more recently, American historical theorists like <a href="http://faculty-web.at.northwestern.edu/music/gjerdingen/index.htm">Robert O. Gjerdingen</a>) differentiate cadences according to the voice-leading found over the dominant harmony. These distinctions do not replace the above PAC/IAC/HC distinctions; rather they add another level of detail that is particularly helpful in model composition. These voice-leading distinctions provide three more cadence categories to complement PAC, IAC, and HC: the <em>simple cadence</em>, the <em>compound cadence</em>, and the <em>double cadence</em>.</p><p>A <em>simple cadence</em> occurs when the dominant harmonic function is articulated by a single chord—either a triad or a seventh chord. The simple cadence can be used in a PAC, IAC, or HC construction, though the seventh-chord version is typically only found in authentic cadences.</p><p>A <em>compound cadence</em> occurs when the bass note <em>sol</em> of the cadential dominant is repeated, often with the second <em>sol</em> an octave lower than the first. The compound cadence comes in three specific forms.</p><p>The first type of compound cadence involves a 4–3 suspension—<em>do</em> to <em>ti</em>—over the <em>sol</em> bass of the dominant harmony. In a four-voice texture, the other two voices sustain a fifth above the bass and an octave above the bass. The <em>thoroughbass</em> figure is typically the abbreviated 4–3, which stands for 8/5/4–8/5/3 in four voices.

The four-stage pattern over the dominant is 5/3–6/4–5/4–5/3. In four voices, the bass is also doubled, or a seventh can be applied to any <em>chord of the fifth</em> (i.e., not the 6/4).</p><figure><img src="images/cadences/Double.png" alt="Double cadence." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Double cadence.</figcaption></figure><h4 id="voice-leading-in-strict-keyboard-style">Voice-leading in strict keyboard style</h4><p>In strict melodic keyboard style, always end an idealized phrase with a perfect authentic cadence (PAC). Approach the melody’s final <em>do</em> by step whenever possible, from <em>re</em> or <em>ti</em>, preferably from <em>re</em>. When using compound or double cadences, use the orientation of upper voices shown in the above figures (transposed to the appropriate key, of course).</p><p>In <em>basso continuo</em> style, the top voice can end with any member of the tonic triad. As much as possible, use the voices provided in the figures above, but invert them (move the tenor line to the top, making the melody and alto the alto and tenor, for example). Simply make sure that if <em>ti</em> occurs in the top voice before the final tonic chord, it resolves its tendency up to <em>do</em>.</p><p>In either case, pay special attention to the cadential six-four version of the compound cadence. Despite forming a consonant triad with the bass, both the sixth and the fourth of the first chord act like suspensions, and therefore <em>must resolve down by step</em> and be prepared smoothly (by common tones or steps). This is true no matter which part is in the melody, alto, or tenor.</p><h2 id="class-discussion-2">Class discussion</h2><p><strong>Tendency tones</strong> - Root in bass goes to root of next chord - Thirds move up by step to root of next chord - Fifths move down by step to root of next chord - Sevenths move down by step to third of next chord</p><p><strong>Notes on predominant and dominant chords</strong> - viio can also be thought of as a V7 with no root.

Even the most basic analysis also involves <em>interpreting</em> the way that specific chords and progressions function within a broader context. Ultimately, no analysis is complete until individual musical elements are interpreted in light of the work as a whole and the historical setting in which the piece occurs. But this resource simply walks through the steps of performing a basic harmonic analysis, interpreting each chord and chord progression in light of the musical phrase in which it occurs.</p><p>The first step in a harmonic analysis is to <em>identify phrases</em>. For the most part, that means beginning by identifying <em>cadences</em>. However, not every type of phrase ends with a cadence, so sensitivity to theme types is important. In classical instrumental music, that means listening for <a href="classicalThemes.html">period- and sentence-like structures</a>. In Classical or Romantic music with text, that means listening in particular for the ends of poetic lines and melodic phrases.</p><p>Once you have identified the musical phrases, it can be helpful to perform a harmonic reduction (thoroughbass reduction, for example) for each phrase. Below the score/thoroughbass line, write the appropriate Roman numeral, <strong>T/S/D</strong> label for each chord, and/or an uninterpreted functional bass symbol for each chord (<strong>T1 T3 S4</strong> etc.). <a href="images/Handouts/HarmoniesByBassScaleDegree.pdf">This handout</a> can help you determine the functions of chords in the thoroughbass reduction.</p><p>Next identify the general harmonic structure of each phrase. Typical phrases in classical music will do one of the following:</p><ul><li>prolong tonic without a cadence (a classical <em>presentation</em> phrase, for example)<br />
</li><li>progress toward an authentic cadence (ending with <strong>V<sup>(7)</sup> I</strong>, <strong>D5 T1</strong> in functional bass)<br />
</li><li>progress toward a half cadence (ending with <strong>V</strong>, <strong>D5</strong> in functional bass)</li></ul><p>If the phrase prolongs tonic (no cadence), label the <em>entire</em> phrase <strong>T–––.</strong></p><p>If the phrase ends with a cadence, identify the <em>cadential progression</em>. This includes the last chord of the tonic zone, optionally followed by a subdominant chord or zone (most often a single chord), and a required dominant zone (most often a single chord or compound cadence formula). Half-cadence phrases end there. Authentic-cadence phrases continue on to a final tonic zone (usually a single chord).</p><p>The the <strong>(P) D T</strong> of the cadential progression should be labeled as such. Once the cadential progression is identified, everything before it is labeled as tonic prolongation. Regardless of whether it is contrapuntal prolongation, a subsidiary progression, or a combination of the two, it will be labeled <strong>T–––.</strong> (See <a href="http://openmusictheory.com/harmonicSyntax2.html">Harmonic syntax – prolongation</a> if those terms are unfamiliar to you.)</p><p>Thus a phrase ending with a half cadence will have a functional analysis that looks like:</p><blockquote><p>T—————— (P) D</p></blockquote><p>A phrase ending with an authentic cadence will have a functional analysis that looks like:</p><blockquote><p>T—————— (P) D T</p></blockquote><p>Following is an excerpt from the opening of Haydn’s Piano Sonata in C Major, Hob.

These norms include progressions that are more or less common than others. Those norms generate expectations for listeners familiar with the style: if <strong>IV–V</strong> is more common than <strong>IV–VI</strong>, the appearance of a <strong>IV</strong> chord generates an expectation that the next chord is more likely to be <strong>V</strong> than it is to be <strong>VI</strong>.</p><p>In Western classical music, harmonies generally group into three <em>harmonic functions</em> — tonic (T), subdominant (S), and dominant (D) — and these functions group together chords that progress to and from other chords in similar ways. For example, since <strong>II</strong> and <strong>IV</strong> are both subdominant chords, they will participate in many of the same kinds of chord progressions, and at times can be substituted for each other with only a minimal change to the musical effect.</p><p>On a local level (chord-to-chord progressions), we can summarize the tendencies of these functions with the cycle <strong>T–S–D–T</strong>. That is, harmonies tend to progress through a cyclical progression of those three functions:</p><blockquote><p><strong>T → S → D → T →</strong> and so on . . .</p></blockquote><p>That does not rule out T progressing to D, D progressing to S, etc. But it does mean that those progressions tend to be less common, at least in classical music.</p><p>Higher-level musical structures also impact the norms according to which these harmonic functions progress. For now, we will consider one higher-level structure that influences chord-progression tendencies — the phrase — and we will limit our study to isolated, complete, self-sufficient phrases. This is an idealized, oversimplified setting — like strict voice-leading — that is useful for learning the basics. Some such phrases even exist in real music! But most of the time there are a number of competing factors that influence the chord-progression strategies employed by a composer at any given moment. However, the idealized phrase is a helpful starting point. Future study will explore how classical composers employ harmonic progressions in larger musical works that combine multiple phrases (which are not self-sufficient) into larger themes and movements.</p><h3 id="the-idealized-phrase">The idealized phrase</h3><p>The <em>idealized phrase</em> (also called the <em>phrase model</em>) is a single musical phrase that progresses through an entire cycle of harmonic functions, beginning and ending on tonic. (Strict voice-leading exercises are such phrases.) These phrases begin with a point of stability (tonic), move away from that stable point, and then eventually lead to a point of high tension and resolution (an <em>authentic cadence</em>). This pattern of stability–instability–stability, or rest–motion–rest, with a single goal at the end, should be familiar both from species counterpoint and from strict keyboard-style voice-leading. (This pattern also governs large-scale formal structures in classical music.)</p><p>The simplest phrase that exhibits this complete harmonic cycle is a tonic-dominant-tonic progression: <strong>I–V–I.</strong> This phrase begins and ends with the most stable harmony (<strong>I</strong>), and includes an <em>authentic cadence</em> (<strong>V–I</strong>). The <strong>V</strong> is the high point of instability, containing the tendency tone (<em>ti</em>) that most strongly points to the final point of arrival (<em>do</em>, or tonic).</p><p>This harmonic cycle can be expanded by inserting a subdominant chord, a destabilized tonic chord, or both, as in the following examples:</p><blockquote><p><strong>I IV V I</strong><br />
<strong>I II V I</strong><br />
<strong>I VI V I</strong><br />
<strong>I VI II V I</strong></p></blockquote><p>In <em>functional bass</em> terms, any harmonic progression that follows the pattern</p><blockquote><p><strong>T1 → (S_) → D5 → T1</strong></p></blockquote><p>can serve as the basis for a complete idealized phrase. (Harmonies in parentheses are optional.)</p><p>Phrases are seldom 3–5 chords long, however, and a harmonic function can be expressed by more than a single chord. Thus we can understand the harmonic functions not simply as chords, but as <em>zones</em> of varying length in a phrase, which can be created by a number of chords or short chord progressions. More generally, then, our idealized musical phrase contains a single progression of functional zones <strong>T → (S) → D → T</strong>, begins with <strong>T1</strong>, and ends with an authentic cadence (<strong>D5–T1</strong>), as seen in the example below.</p><h3 id="triggering-and-prolonging-harmonic-functions-in-an-idealized-phrase">Triggering and prolonging harmonic functions in an idealized phrase</h3><p>To establish, or trigger, a harmonic functional zone, composers tend to use <em>a fixed scale degree in the bass</em>. In other words, tonic tends to be triggered by <strong>T1</strong> (always <strong>I</strong>), subdominant by <strong>S2</strong> or <strong>S4</strong> (including a variety of <strong>II</strong> and <strong>IV</strong> chords, in in root position or inversions, with and without sevenths), and dominant by <strong>D5</strong> (<strong>V</strong>, with or without a seventh, or a <a href="cadenceTypes"><em>compound cadence</em></a>). These four categories of chords — <strong>T1</strong>, <strong>S2</strong>, <strong>S4</strong>, and <strong>D5</strong> — are called <em>functional chords</em> (because they trigger the function) or <em>cadential chords</em> (because they can participate in a cadence).</p><p>Other chords are often called <em>contrapuntal chords</em> or <em>embellishing chords</em>, and are typically used to <em>prolong</em> a function throughout the zone.</p><p>Functional prolongations are shown in a harmonic analysis by writing/typing T, S, or D underneath the individual chord labels (Roman numerals or functional bass) and extending a line from the beginning of the functional zone to the end.</p><p>The following excerpt is from Mozart’s Piano Sonata in A Major, K. 331, I., mm. 1–4, with a harmonic reduction and analysis provided below the original score. Such an analysis is called an <em>interpreted</em> harmonic analysis, because the harmonies are interpreted according to the way they behave in the phrase, rather than merely labeled. In this phrase, note the following:</p><ul><li>The tonic zone is triggered by a root-position tonic triad (<strong>I</strong> or <strong>T1</strong>).<br />
</li><li>Contrapuntal dominant chords (<strong>D7</strong> — first-inversion dominant chords) create a passing bass motion between the opening <strong>I</strong> chord, the <strong>vi</strong> in m. 3, and the return of <strong>I</strong> in m. 4.<br />
</li><li>The <a href="harmonicAnalysis">cadential progression</a> begins in m. 4 with the move from <strong>I</strong> to <strong>ii<sup>6</sup></strong> (<strong>S4</strong>) and then to the cadential six-four and dominant triad (<strong>D5</strong>). Note that the entirety of the cadential progression in m. 4 is made up of <em>cadential chords</em> — chords with fixed scale degrees in the bass.<br />
</li><li>In contrast, the entire tonic-prolongation zone is made up of <em>contrapuntal chords</em> — variable scale degrees in the bass — with the exception of the <strong>I</strong> chord that triggered the tonic function.<br />
</li><li>The <strong>vi</strong> chord is a root-position chord, but still an embellishing chord, while the <strong>ii<sup>6</sup></strong> is an inverted chord, but still a functional/cadential chord. The difference is not the inversion, but the scale degree of the bass.</li></ul><p><a href="/images/harmony/k331-reduction.png"><img src="/images/harmony/k331-reduction.png" /></a></p><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:5yfZxPrcN0hjwzU1OKIsdQ" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe><p><br/></p><p>Not all classical phrases as neatly fit the general trends outlined in this resource. As discussed in <a href="tendency">Style and tendency</a>, the principles of harmonic syntax are both reliable and bendable/breakable, and it is often the music that bends/breaks the “rules” in interesting ways that we care about the most. So in your own analyses, keep these principles in mind as <em>general</em> principles, and simultaneously look for where composers meet these expectations as well as where they break them.</p><p>For more details on the triggering and prolonging of harmonic functions in a classical phrase, see <a href="harmonicSyntax2">Harmonic syntax – prolongation</a>.</p><h2 id="class-discussion-3">Class discussion</h2><p><strong>How do we harmonize a melody?</strong> - Pick a key - Figure out the harmonic rhythm - Determine where and what type your cadences are (type determined by notes in melody. Ex: in C, if our last notes in the soprano are B and C we can’t have a plagal cadence because there is no ti in IV) - Harmonies (using circle of fifths progressions) - Bassline - Inner voices</p><p><strong>When in doubt: K.I.S.S.</strong> - Focusing on smooth voice leading, correct doubling, and correct tendency tone resolutions will make this process a lot easier! If your voice leading is good, you avoid dealing with a lot of errors because they’re symptoms of bad voice leading</p><p><strong>A first attempt at part-writing</strong> - Possible progression: I - ii - V7 - I - As you fill in notes, be making sure all chord members are present. Triads always need the third. Seventh chords always need the third and the seventh. - Voicing of the last chord (C’s in SAB, E in T) isn’t ideal. It’s very spread out and there’s a third between B and T, which can make the chord sound muddier than if it were somewhere between the upper three voices. This happened because of repeated tones in previous chords - When determining your voicings, think of the harmonic series! There’s a lot of space between the lower notes but there’s progressively less the higher you go. If you try to emulate this in your voicings, you’ll end up with better sounding, stronger parts that are less prone to errors</p><h2 id="class-discussion-4">Class discussion</h2><p><strong>Written pitch</strong>: what is written on the page. If you’re playing a transposed instrument, the note you are playing will be transposed too.</p><p><strong>Sounding pitch</strong>: the “actual” note being played. Concert A is concert A no matter what instrument you’re playing.</p><p><strong>Concert pitch</strong>: interchangeable with sounding pitch. Basically means “in C.” This is the baseline point of reference for everything else.</p><p>Remember that the process of transposition relies on compensation. If an instrument is pitched lower, its written pitches are <em>higher</em> than concert pitch. Ex: Bb trumpet’s written C is concert Bb.</p><p><strong>Ranges</strong> There is a range and transposition handout to print out that is very handy! It is in lesson 12a. It has very conservative ranges though for Brass instruments. It has nice normal ranges for everything.</p><p><strong>Transposition hints</strong> You can organize various instruments according to how their music is written: - <strong>C instruments</strong>: written/sounding pitches match! These are the easy ones. - <strong>Octave displacing instruments</strong>: instruments play up or down an octave from what is written. Generally high instruments get written an octave lower(to sound higher), and low instruments get written an octave higher (to sound lower) (think about compensation like we talked about earlier!). - <strong>Bb instruments</strong>: transpose(sounds) down a M2 from written pitch. Some instruments (like tenor sax) have an additional octave displacement.You have to write a step higher,so it sounds a step lower. - <strong>Eb instruments</strong>: transposition is based around M6. Some instruments have octave displacements, and Eb clarinet is transposed up a m3 from written. This one is the only exception of transposing up. Baritone sax has a pretty easy trick for transposing it! - Quick way to remember what keys the saxophones are in: organize them ascending to descending and they will alternate Bb and Eb (soprano, alto, tenor, bari). Or think of soprano/tenor and alto/bari as pairs. - <strong>F instruments</strong>: transpose down a P5 from written pitch. - Others - <strong>Clarinet in A</strong>: down a m3 from written pitch - <strong>Alto flute</strong>: written in G, transpose down a P4 from written pitch.

You have to have this downward motion. If you don’t, you may have to alter the chord when inserting a suspension. We label how suspensions resolve with its intervalic label. Anything above the bass voice, you write the interval of the two notes of the suspension against the bass note.Ex: C in the bass with a D to C resolution in the alto voice is a “Sus 9-8.” If this example occurs in the tenor voice, it is considered 2-1. The most common suspensions are 4-3, 7-6, 9-8.</p><p>If the suspension is in the bass, you measure it against the most dissonant voice. They will always be labeled 2-3 because there will always be a second. Also note that the numbers get bigger when labeling.

You can tell what note the root is because its number correlates directly to its scale degree. For example, in C major vi indicates an A minor chord because A is the sixth scale degree in that key. As we’ll see in a second, the root can be altered just like the other chord members - Uppercase/lowercase identifies the third in relation to the root (major/minor) - 5ths are assumed perfect unless there’s a +, a half-diminished, or a diminished sign in the superscript - The diminished sign is special because it indicates that both the fifth and seventh are lowered. You can tell the difference from the half-diminished sign because the latter has a slash through it (it’s cut in “half”) - 7 by itself = dominant 7th. Can be altered with M, a half-diminished, or a diminished sign - Sometimes chords like IV7 are notated without the clarification that it’s a major seventh chord–you’re expected to know because a major seventh is diatonic.

The first is to label chords with Roman numerals, thoroughbass figures, and functional labels. When doing so, place the appropriate Roman numeral <em>below</em> the bass line, the thoroughbass figure <em>above</em> the bass line (since it represents the upper voices), and place a functional label <strong>T</strong>/<strong>S</strong>/<strong>D</strong> below the Roman numeral (no <strong>Tx</strong>; simply call a <strong>VI</strong> chord <strong>T</strong>). For now this label can simply apply T, S, or D to individual chords; in the future, we will alter this practice slightly in order to show <a href="harmonicSyntax2.html">functional prolongation</a>. The first example shows individual chord functions, and the second example shows functional prolongation.</p><p><a href="/images/harmony/RNsIndividualFunctions.png"><img src="/images/harmony/RNsIndividualFunctions.png" /></a></p><p><a href="/images/harmony/RNsFunctionalProlongation.png"><img src="/images/harmony/RNsFunctionalProlongation.png" /></a></p><p>The second way to label a harmonic progression is what Quinn calls <em>functional bass</em>. Functional bass symbols combine a chord’s function (<strong>T</strong>, <strong>S</strong>, <strong>D</strong>, or <strong>Tx</strong>) with an Arabic numeral denoting the scale degree of its bass note. A tonic chord with <em>do</em> in the bass is <strong>T1</strong>, a dominant chord with <em>ti</em> in the bass is <strong>D7</strong>, etc. If the bass note is chromatically altered, use a <strong>+</strong> or <strong>–</strong> to denote raised or lowered (<em>la</em> and <em>ti</em> in minor do not count, since <em>le</em>, <em>la</em>, <em>te</em>, and <em>ti</em> all belong to minor, but you can use +/– for clarity if you like). And if there is a chromatically altered note anywhere in the chord, put the functional bass symbol inside square brackets: <strong>[S6]</strong>, <strong>[S+4]</strong>, <strong>[T–7]</strong>, etc. (See <a href="alteredSubdominants.html">Chromatically altered subdominant chords</a>, <a href="appliedChords.html">Applied chords</a>, and <a href="modalMixture.html">Modal mixture</a> for more information on common chromatically altered chords.)</p><p><a href="/images/harmony/FunctionalBassFunctions.png"><img src="/images/harmony/FunctionalBassFunctions.png" /></a></p><p>Quinn also advocates using what I call <em>interpreted functional bass</em>. This nomenclature uses the same symbols, but uses parentheses to denote <a href="http://openmusictheory.com/harmonicSyntax2.html"><em>contrapuntal prolongation</em></a> and lower-case postscripts to explain the contrapuntal role of the embellishing chord (p for passing, n for neighbor, i for incomplete neighbor, d for divider, e for embellishing — all of these refer to the voice-leading pattern in the bass voice). Following is an example of interpreted functional bass.</p><p><a href="/images/harmony/InterpretedFunctionalBass.png"><img src="/images/harmony/InterpretedFunctionalBass.png" /></a></p><p>In this text, we primarily use the first method of Roman numerals and (prolonged) harmonic functions, since it is the most common in North American music theory. However, functional bass can be helpful for identifying categories of chords that belong together. For example, in a dictation or transcription task, we might hear <em>re</em> in the bass but not know what specific chord it is. If context tells us it is likely a dominant chord, rather than subdominant, we can label it <strong>D2</strong>. This rules out <strong>II</strong> (a subdominant chord) but keeps open multiple dominant options like <strong>V<sup>6/4</sup></strong> or <strong>VII<sup>6</sup></strong> until we are able to make a final determination. Similarly, when composing, there are patterns that might take an <strong>S4</strong>, with the specific chord (<strong>IV</strong> or <strong>II<sup>6</sup></strong>) determined by voice-leading rather than harmonic syntax, but where a <strong>D4</strong> chord (<strong>V<sup>4/2</sup></strong>) would be syntactically inappropriate, regardless of voice-leading.</p><p>Thus, when referring to specific chords, we will use Roman numerals to label the chords and functional labels to interpret their role in context. When referring to broader categories of chords, we will more often use functional bass.</p><h3 id="class-discussion-9">Class discussion</h3><p><strong>Pentatonic Scales Tricks</strong></p><p>-Take out the tri-tone notes (Degree 4 and 7) from the major scale for major pentatonic.</p><p>-Minor pentatonic can be remembered as taking out scale degree 2 and 6.</p><p>-Major and Minor are the same pitches, but just organized in a different order (different starting point).

There are two types of steps: <em>half steps</em> and <em>whole steps</em>. A half step (H) consists of two adjacent pitches on the keyboard. A whole step (W) consists of two half steps. Usually, the pitches in a scale are each notated with different letter names, though this isn’t always possible or desirable.</p><h4 id="the-major-scale">The major scale</h4><p>A major scale, a sound with which you are undoubtedly familiar, consists of seven whole (W) and half (H) steps in the following succession: W-W-H-W-W-W-H. The first pitch of the scale, called the <em>tonic</em>, is the pitch upon which the rest of the scale is based. When the scale ascends, the tonic is repeated at the end an octave higher.</p><p>Here is the D major scale. It is called the “D major scale” because the pitch D is the <em>tonic</em> and is heard at both ends of the scale.</p><figure><img src="images/majorscale.png" alt="The major scale" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">The major scale</figcaption></figure><h4 id="scale-degrees-and-solfège">Scale degrees and solfège</h4><p>While ISO notation allows us to label a pitch in its specific register, it is often useful to know where that pitch fits within a given scale. For example, the pitch class D is the first (and last) note of the D-major scale. The pitch class A is the fifth note of the D-major scale. When described in this way, we call the notes <em>scale degrees</em>, because they’re placed in context of a specific scale. Solfège syllables, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solfège">a centuries-old method of teaching pitch and sight singing</a>, can also be used to represent scale degrees (when used in this way, this system is specifically called movable-<em>do</em> solfège).</p><p>Scale degrees are labeled with Arabic numerals and carets (^). The illustration below shows a D-major scale and corresponding ISO notation, scale degrees, and solfège syllables.</p><p><a href="images/sdsf.png"><img src="images/sdsf.png"></a></p><h4 id="the-minor-scale">The minor scale</h4><p>Another scale with which you are likely very familiar is the minor scale. There are several scales that one might describe as <em>minor</em>, all of which have a characteristic third scale degree that is lower than the one found in the major scale. The minor scale most frequently used in tonal music from the Common Practice period is based on the <em>aeolian mode</em> (you’ll read more about modes later), which is sometimes referred to as the <em>natural minor</em> scale.</p><p>The natural minor scale consists of seven whole (W) and half (H) steps in the following succession: W-H-W-W-H-W-W. Note the changes in solfège syllables.</p><p><a href="images/sdsf-naturalMinor.png"><img src="images/sdsf-naturalMinor.png"></a></p><p>If you sing through the above example, you’ll notice that the ending lacks the same sense of closure you heard in the major scale. This closure is created in the major scale, in part, by the ascending semitone between <em>ti</em> and <em>do</em>. Composers often want to have this sense of closure when using the minor mode, too. They’re able to achieve this by applying an accidental to the seventh scale degree, raising it by a semitone. If you do this within the context of the natural minor scale, you get something called the <em>harmonic minor</em> scale.</p><p><a href="images/sdsf-harmonicMinor.png"><img src="images/sdsf-harmonicMinor.png"></a></p><p>Now the last two notes of the scale sound much more conclusive, but you might have found it difficult to sing <em>le</em> to <em>ti</em>. When writing melodies in a minor key, composers often “corrected” this by raising <em>le</em> by a semitone to become <em>la</em> when approaching the note <em>ti</em>. When the melody descended from <em>do</em>, the closure from <em>ti</em> to <em>do</em> isn’t needed; likewise, it is no longer necessary to “correct” <em>le</em>, so the natural form of the minor scale is used again. Together, these different ascending and descending versions are called the <em>melodic minor</em> scale.</p><p>When ascending, the <em>melodic minor</em> scale uses <em>la</em> and <em>ti</em>.</p><p><a href="images/sdsf-melodicMinorAsc.png"><img src="images/sdsf-melodicMinorAsc.png"></a></p><p>When descending, the <em>melodic minor</em> scale uses the “natural” <em>te</em> and <em>le</em>.</p><p><a href="images/sdsf-melodicMinorDesc.png"><img src="images/sdsf-melodicMinorDesc.png"></a></p><p>Truth be told, most composers don’t really think about three different “forms” of the minor scale. The <em>harmonic minor</em> scale simply represents composers’ tendency to use <em>ti</em> when building harmonies that include the seventh scale degree in the minor mode. Likewise, the <em>melodic minor</em> scale is derived from composers’ desire to avoid the melodic augmented second interval (more on this in the <a href="intervals.html">intervals</a> section) between <em>le</em> and <em>ti</em> (and some chose not to avoid this!). In reality, there is only one “version” of the minor scale. Context determines when a composer might use <em>la</em> and <em>ti</em> when writing music in a minor key.</p><h3 id="class-discussion-10">Class Discussion</h3><h5 id="fix-mm.-5-in-common-examples-of-simple-quadruple-meters-with-correct-beaming-4-la-li.">Fix mm. 5 in Common Examples of simple quadruple meters with correct beaming (4 la li).</h5><p><strong>What is rhythm?</strong> - A division of the beat.

Durations are notated with either unfilled or filled noteheads. Unfilled noteheads can appear with or without a stem; filled noteheads always appear with a stem. Flags can be added to the stems of filled noteheads; each flag shortens the duration by half.</p><p><img src="images/durations.png" width="60%"></p><h4 id="rests">Rests</h4><p>Rests represent silence in musical notation. For each durational symbol there exists a corresponding rest.</p><p><img src="images/rests.png" width="60%"></p><h4 id="dots-and-ties">Dots and ties</h4><p>Dots and ties allow for basic durations to be lengthened. A dot occurs after a pitch or a rest, and it increases its duration by half. For example, if a quarter note is equivalent in duration to two eighth notes, a dotted quarter note would be equivalent to <em>three</em> eighth notes. Generally, undotted notes divide into two notes; dotted notes divide into three. Thus, undotted notes are typically used to represent the beat level in simple meter, while dotted notes are used to represent the beat in compound meter.</p><p>Multiple dots can be added to a duration. Subsequent dots add half the duration of the previous dot.

Standard meters in Western music can be classified into <em>simple meters</em> and <em>compound meters</em>, as well as <em>duple</em>, <em>triple</em>, and <em>quadruple</em> meters.</p><p>Duple, triple, and quadruple classifications result from the relationship between the counting pulse and the pulses that are <em>slower</em> than the counting pulse. In other words, it is a question of <em>grouping</em>: how many beats occur in each bar. If counting-pulse beats group into twos, we have duple meter; groups of three, triple meter; groups of four, quadruple meter. Conducting patterns are determined based on these classifications.</p><p>Simple and compound classifications result from the relationship between the counting pulse and the pulses that are <em>faster</em> than the counting pulse. In other words, it is a question of <em>division</em>: does each beat divide into two equal parts, or three equal parts. Meters that divide the beat into two equal parts are <em>simple meters</em>.</p><p>There are three types of standard simple meters in Western music:</p><ul><li>simple duple (beats group into two, divide into two)</li><li>simple triple (beats group into three, divide into two)</li><li>simple quadruple (beats group into four, divide into two)</li></ul><p>In a time signature, the <em>top number</em> (and the top number only!) describes the type of meter.

If a simple meter is notated such that each quarter note corresponds to a beat, the bottom number of the time signature is 4. If a simple meter is notated such that each half note corresponds to a beat, the bottom number of the time signature is 2. If a simple meter is notated such that each eighth note corresponds to a beat, the bottom number of the time signature is 8. And so on.</p><h3 id="beaming">Beaming</h3><p>It’s important to remember that notation is intended to be read by performers. You should always strive to make your notation as easy to interpret as possible. Part of this includes grouping the rhythms such that they convey the beat unit and the beat division. <em>Beams</em> are used to group any notes at the beat division level or shorter that fall within the same beat.</p><p>In this example, the eighth notes are not grouped with beams, making it difficult to interpret the triple meter.</p><p><a href="images/withoutbeams.png"><img src="images/withoutbeams.png" width="70%"></a></p><p>If we re-notate the above example so that the notes that fall within the same beat are grouped together with a beam, it makes the music much easier to read.</p><p><a href="images/beams.png"><img src="images/beams.png" width="70%"></a></p><h4 id="borrowed-divisions">Borrowed divisions</h4><p>Typically, a meter is defined by the presence of a consistent beat division: division by two in simple meter, and by three in compound meter.

The first example is completely in C, so it’s diatonic. When a sequence is diatonic you don’t label the quality of the interval of transposition because it will vary between each scale degree - For chromatic sequences, you have to label the interval <em>with</em> its quality because that determines the “key” - Always be thinking about the smallest possible pattern to identify! In example 4, the sequence can technically be a whole beat <em>or</em> half a beat. However, it is suggested to ID it as being half a beat because that’s simpler (especially if you’re expected to write out the rest)</p><p><strong>Ascending vs. descending</strong> - Intervals within the pattern will be ascending or descending, but the only thing we care about is the interval transposition, or the <em>overall</em> motion between each sequence. The second example is a descending sequence because the overall transposition is down by a second</p><p>Some sequences will have qualities of diatonic and chromatic sequences. Ex. 5’s inner intervals are fixed, the same as in a chromatic sequence, but the interval of transposition is a “diatonic third,” descending in thirds down the C major scale.</p><p><strong>How to label sequences:</strong> put a bracket over the top of the areas you want to ID as a sequence, then draw arrows pointing from the one on the left to the one on the right. Over the top of the arrow, indicate whether it’s ascending/descending with an up or down arrow, and also include a number (and quality, if the sequence is chromatic) to ID the interval of transposition.</p><p><strong><em>Harmonic sequences</em></strong></p><p><strong>A two voice sequence</strong> - Is this example functional? Can you harmonize the example (come up with a progression for it)? Can we have a cadence as we normally would? - Sequences don’t have to follow functional tonal harmony rules, which is why it’s okay for us to have a V6/4 as our penultimate chord in this example. It’s like how passing chords don’t have to follow circle-of-fifths progression rules, except it’s all the time - Adding the alto voice - This also ends up being a sequence! From the second measure, the pattern is down a third + up a second, or an overall transposition interval of a second</p><p><strong>Common sequences</strong> - Parallel 6 chords - Made entirely of first inversion chords. Goal is a smooth + strong bassline - Always descending - Pachelbel’s sequence - Suuuuuuuper prevalent, you hear it everywhere - This is the reason we have iii -&gt; IV in our chord progression chart! This progression works in Pachelbel’s Canon in D and is used widely even today</p><h2 id="class-discussion-12">Class Discussion</h2><p>Tertian Harmnoy: Harmony based on stacked thirds. <em>(diatonic triad, stacked thirds, is not necessarily the same as a “triad”-implies any collection of three pitches)</em></p><p><strong>ID Triads?</strong> - M: M3 + m3 (P5 outside) - m: m3 + M3 (P5 outside) - d: m3 + m3 (d5 outside) - A: M3 + M3 (A5 outside)</p><p>Note that all 3rds are either major or minor! Don’t even worry about diminished thirds.</p><p>Additional tips: - Knowing your scales can help identify triads, especially in a key with lots of sharps or flats where many of the possible altered notes are double sharps or flats. - Possible groupings for memorization - M and A both “start” with a M3, m and d both start with a m3 - M and m are more familiar whereas A and d are newer and “weirder,” have altered 5ths</p><p><strong>ID inversions?</strong> - Root position: starting point (stacked thirds) - Determine the quality of the third and the quality of the fifth to find the quality of the chord. - 1st inversion: take the root and move it to the top (3rd is on the bottom) - 2nd inversion: take the third and move it to the top (5th is on the bottom)</p><ul><li>The only thing that determines your inversion is the lowest/bass pitched note. <em>(note that when actually labeling inversions, the numbers will be superscript and stacked)</em></li></ul><p><strong>ID closed vs open voicing?</strong> - Closed voicing = closest notes can be notated together on a staff, open = spread out? (No: “spread out” is not specific enough) - Closed voicing = voices within a 4th, open = voices larger apart than a 4th? (On the right track, but not quite!) - Closed voicing = within an octave, open voicing = greater than an octave?</p><p>These are all good guesses, but closed voicing means stacking all chord members in ascending order without skipping over any of them. Open voicing is anything <em>but</em> that.</p><ul><li>Open voicing = does not have the first/third/fifth in the same octave.</li><li>Closed is in the same octave and stacked as closely to the bottom as possible.

The root is the <em>lowest</em> in the three-pitch-class clump.

The root and quality will tell you what three pitch classes belong to the triad. For example, <strong>C<sup>+</sup></strong> tells you the root is C, and the quality is augmented. Since the quality is augmented, there is a major third above the root (E) and an augmented fifth above the root (G-sharp). Since there is no bass note appended to the lead-sheet symbol, the bass note is the same as the root: C. Write a C on the staff (in any comfortable register), then write the other chord tones (E and G-sharp) <em>above</em> the C (see the Caug triad in the above figure).</p><p>For <strong>Cm/E♭</strong>, the root is C, and the quality is minor. Since the quality is minor, there is a minor third above the root (E-flat) and a perfect fifth above the root (G). The slash identifies E-flat as the bass note. Write the E-flat on the staff. Then write a C and a G above it to complete the chord (again, see above).</p><p>When all the members of the triad are as close to the bass note as they can be, the chord is in what is called <em>close position</em> (C, Cm/E♭, and Cdim/G♭ above). When there are spaces between chord tones, the chord is in <em>open position</em> (Caug above). (In certain musical situations, only one of those positions will be useful or desirable.)</p><h4 id="listening-to-triads">Listening to triads</h4><p>Each triad quality has its own distinct sound, and to an extent that sound is preserved even when the chord is <em>inverted</em> (when the pitch classes are arranged so that a pitch class other than the root is in the lowest voice). As you practice identifying and writing triads, be sure to play the triads, both to check your analysis/writing and to develop the ability to identify chord qualities quickly by ear.</p><h4 id="inversions">Inversions</h4><p>Both bass lines and root progressions are important for the study and mastery of tonal harmony. Most of our work will focus on the bass lines, and what follows will help you analyze the root progressions present in any figured bass line.

In this technique, we pivot on a borrowed chord. Just like a regular pivot modulation, these generally happen in the middle of a phrase because you need a functional progression on both sides</p><p><strong>Modulation #3</strong> - Where does this modulation actually happen? Is it a pivot or a phrase modulation? - Pivot modulation. Remember that there’s a difference b/w a deceptive <em>cadence</em> and a deceptive <em>progression</em>. We can’t do a direct modulation after a deceptive progression because there’s no cadence–the phrase hasn’t ended. - We modulate on the vii07 in the seventh measure! It’s just a respelling of the vii04/2 in the second measure. This is called an <em>enharmonic modulation</em>: by respelling the chord, it takes on a function in the new key. In this case, we’ve pivoting on the respelled vii07 - When writing the pivot, the chord will be spelled in one of the two keys. This means you have to figure out what the inversion would be in the other key. For this example, you would write vii04/2 in the top half of the bracket, and vii07 in the bottom half of the new key. Seeing both chords are vii07, we will know that you are saying the chords are enharmonically equivalent and that you correctly ID’d the technique - You can also modulate using a secondary vii07 - Common respelled chords: augmented triads (used as V chords) and Fr+6 (respelled as the Fr+6 of the key a tritone away from the home key–sees VERY little use because this isn’t as flexible)</p><p><strong>Modulations #5 and #6</strong> - Another enharmonic modulation, this time respelling a V as a Ger+6 in the new key by respelling the seventh. In this example, a G7 is respelled as a Ger+6 in the key of B major just by respelling the F as an E# - In example 5, the Ger+6 has a predominant function. It comes right before I6/4 - V, which are lumped together and have a dominant function - When writing out the pivot bracket where the Ger+6 is in the home key, like in example 6, we would label the chord Ger+6 in the top bracket <em>even though</em> it has been respelled. By putting Ger+6 in the top half of the bracket and V7 in the bottom half, we actually inform whoever is looking at our analysis that we understand it has been respelled - The progression must be functional on both sides for a pivot modulation, but that’s especially true for these weird modulations that pivot on a chord with different functions in each key. For example, in example 6 the Ger+6 has a predominant function, but when it is respelled as a V7 it has a dominant function</p><h2 id="class-discussion-15">Class discussion</h2><p><strong>Augmented sixth chords</strong> - Not based in tertian harmony, so their “Roman numerals” are written differently than normal - They’re called augmented sixth chords because they contain an augmented sixth - The primary reason for these is voice leading–the raised tone moves up, the lowered tone moves down. Both tones will proceed to the root of the next chord - a default +6 chord will proceed to V and has <strong>predominant function</strong></p><p><strong>Think of the components of these chords using scale degrees!</strong> - Italian (It): b6, #4, 1 (x2) - German (Ger): b6, #4, 1, b3 - French (Fr): b6, #4, 1, 2 - Ger+6 and Fr+6 are just It+6s with extra stuff!</p><p>Italian is the “basic” flavor: it just contains all the notes that all the +6 chords have. In my experience, I actually had more trouble IDing It+6 chords than the other two because I psyched myself out looking for a fourth tone that obviously was not there. So, be aware that It+6s are going ot have a different shape than Ger+6 and Fr+6.</p><p>Speaking of shape, Ger+6s will usually appear in the same shape as a V6/5, while Fr+6 will usually appear in the same shape as a V4/3. The default shape for a It+6 is like a V6. (V(7) is used as a filler for simplicity: remember that these all have predominant function.ex: Ab C Eb F# can be renamed as Ab C Eb Gb to make a Ab7 chord instead of Aug6 chord)</p><p>The “inversion” doesn’t affect how we label these. No matter which note is in the bass, it’s always written as the default (x)+6. This is because the chord is <em>not</em> made up of stacked thirds, so our inversion labeling system doesn’t translate properly.</p><p>Common fix for Ger+6 resolution: have it go to a I6/4! Also be aware that composers may enharmonically write any of the tones for voice leading purposes (again, the primary use of these chords is just cool-sounding voice leading)</p><p><strong>Augmented sixth chords resolving to a non-dominant harmony</strong> - By writing some notes enharmonically, we can basically sub in one dominant chord for another. In the example we did in class (in C), the respelled Ger+6 translated to a Db7, which still moved nicely over to V7. - Process: writing out the full chord (Db F Ab B) and respelling the B as a Cb. Cb wants to resolve down to the B in the next chord, and the F carries through to be the seventh. - If you keep the chord as written, we have our normal +6 chord function: the actual +6 resolves outward to the root of the next chord. So our original +6 chord from the example resolves to a C major chord. - Labeling: instead of using our “in the key of” secondary dominant labeling, the slash indicates “going to” and you write the scale degree below the slash. The Ger+6 in this example would be written as Ger+6/^1 (remember the caret should be written above the number) - In this instance, Ger+6/^1 actually has <em>dominant</em> function, rather than predominant. It subs in for V7 and proceeds straight to I. Think of respelling the chord as a Db7! Ger+6s can have dominant function…but only sometimes</p><p><strong>This was a lot of info, so here’s the most important things to remember:</strong> - Tones of each kind of +6 chord - How the different tones resolve - Function(s) of a +6 chord</p><h2 id="class-discussion-16">Class discussion</h2><p><strong>Key signature vs. key</strong> - You don’t have to change key signatures to modulate. Think of a piece in sonata-allegro form: it will rapidly modulate during the development, but we don’t get a key signature change for each one. - Tonic defines key. Key signatures are shorthand for the benefit of the performer, they have nothing to do with the actual key</p><p><strong>Key relationships</strong> - Each key has five closely related keys: the key with one more sharp, the key with one more flat, and the relative minor keys of all three. - Ex: the closely related keys to C major are F and G major + A, D, and E minor. The minor keys are relative to the major keys, which include C major and the keys one sharp and one flat in either direction.</p><p><strong>Tonicization vs. modulation: How do we tell the difference?</strong> - Signaling is the same for both: look for accidentals, namely raised notes (ti in the temporary/new key, fi in the current key) - Placement: is the new key area happening at the end of a phrase or is it in the middle? Furthmore, what is <em>around</em> it? If we stay in the new key, we’ve modulated, but if it’s temporary it’s tonicization. - In the second example we listened to in class, we have a V/VI - VI progression to the first fermata. However, the chords after it are still in the key of I. This indicates that we haven’t changed keys. If we had, the following chords wouldn’t make as much sense in I because they’re actually in the key of VI - Ear training is vital. We talked about it a lot in class, but being able to follow <em>do</em> as it moves between keys will speed up the process of figuring out whether we’re tonicizing or modulating - Be aware that the actual <em>look</em> of the music can be deceiving. In the Chopin example we went over in class, he starts tonicizing Bb major. Since the example is in G minor, Bb major’s relative minor, putting in a V/III requires no accidentals. Hunting for accidentals is a good start for finding secondary dominants and/or modulations, but as with most theory things…it doesn’t always work</p><p>If it establishes the new key it’s a modulation. However, this requires multiple things: you have to have a cadence, and you have to stay in the new key. “Does the phrase feel solid and stable in a new key?” is a really subjective question, though, which is how arguments/debate arise.</p><h2 id="class-discussion-17">Class discussion</h2><p>How do we know if a note is a non-chord tone?</p><p>Rhythms and placement in the bar. If the notes are on the downbeat or repeated many times, it is likely a chord tone.</p><p>Do the notes fit if we stack thirds?</p><p>Function!</p><p>Look for non-chord tone patterns and how they move. Think neighbor tones or suspensions etc.</p><h3 id="extended-tertian-harmony-and-non-chord-tones">Extended Tertian Harmony and Non-chord tones</h3><p>Extended harmony is anything beyond the seventh in a triadic chord. This includes 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths. Labeled G9, G11, and G13 (for dominant chords). - G9 is G,B,D,F,A - G11 is G,B,D,F,A,C - G13 is G,B,D,F,A,C,E</p><p>If a non-chord tone doesn’t fit within our given possibilities, it’s most likely an extension. Your options for non-chord tones are: - passing tone - neighbor tone - escape tone - appogiatura - suspension - retardation - pedal tone (pedal point) - anticipation</p><p>If you have what looks like a G7, and you see an A, but it doesn’t fit into any of these non-chord tone motion options, you have a G9.</p><h4 id="dominant-ninth-chords">Dominant Ninth Chords</h4><p>What are the differences between these chords? 1. V9 - when you have just a 9 next to the V, it includes all the triadic tones up to the ninth. - in C, spelled G,B,D,F,A. 2. Vadd9 - “add” means to add a note to the triadic harmony, in this case, you’re adding the 9th. - in C, spelled G,B,D,A. - also often grouped like G,A,B,D. - this is not the same as sub. - sub means to substitute a chord tone with the given note. 3. V9 65 - still spelled like a V9 but in first inversion (of seventh chord inversions). - if the ninth is on the bottom, it’s probably not a ninth, but a pedal tone. 4. Vsub13 - sub effects a chord tone, while add doesn’t. - though spelled the same as a iii6, it functions as the dominant so it is labelled Vsub13 (or Vsub6). - in C, spelled G,B,E.</p><p>A V9 chord is the combination of a V7 and a G#%7. In A, the lower 4 notes are E,G#,B,D (V7). The upper 4 notes are G#,B,D,F#. - when spelling dominant extentions use the diatonic scale degrees in the key of the tonic.</p><p><strong>ALL OF THIS BEING SAID,</strong> the ninth chord is a last resort. It is rare in the type of music that this system of tonal analysis was created to analyze. Extentions are used mainly for jazz, which is far out of our fixed system of analysis.</p><p>Whether you analyze a tone as an extention or non-chord tone is up to how you hear it. Just make sure you label the tone to match what your analysis says.</p><p>In the case of a b9, (in A minor) the chord symbol would be a E7(b9). In the roman numeral analysis you would write V9, because the b9 is naturally occuring in the key. It is altered in the parallel major (how we label dominant extentions) so it is labelled as E7(b9) in chord symbols.</p><h2 id="class-discussion-18">Class discussion</h2><p>Mode mixture, modal interchange, and borrowed harmony all = the same thing</p><p>Mode mixture is just borrowing chords from parallel modes. Remember that parallel modes all share the same tonic. For example, we’ll be dealing with all C scales, not every no-accidentals scale</p><p>V and vii0 are technically borrowed from the major key, we just use them in minor because it sounds pretty (stronger resolutions and actual dominant function)</p><p><strong>Variations between parallel major and minor</strong> - Notice the voice leading is the <em>same</em>! This is why we say major and minor aren’t really different keys at all: their function is exactly the same. Be thinking about voice leading and harmony rather than the actual notes</p><p><strong>Borrowing chords from the parallel minor (in C)</strong> - What do we have to do to alter ii to ii0? - Change the A in the tenor to an Ab. This is <em>le</em>, which makes our tenor line stronger because le has a stronger resolution down to sol than la (half step rather than whole step) - What do we have to do to alter vi to VI? - Alter the E in the alto to an Eb, and the A’s in the tenor and bass to Ab’s. - <em>Do not</em> raise the C in the soprano to a C#. While that would create an A major chord, what we actually want is an Ab major chord because that’s what is diatonic to C minor, the mode we’re borrowing from. - When we’re borrowing chords, if the root is altered you need to indicate it by putting an accidental in front. For example, the altered vi we went over in class would be written as bVI…very nicely eliminating the confusion of what chord it’s actually supposed to be. The A major chord would actually be a V/ii. - We did a Picardy third. This is when everything is in minor but you end on the major I.</p><p><strong>More borrowing from the parallel minor</strong> - vii%7 to vii07: pretty standard, stronger resolution because we have le instead of la - vii%7 to bVII7: weird to hear because we’re so used to ti -&gt; do resolutions, so have te instead sounds “wrong” - V7 to v7: “this one just sucks, right?” - We need ti in order to have dominant function! Ti is your best friend who makes things actually sound nice - If you’re going to do mode mixture, be sure to be consistent with altered tones. If you used both V7 and bVII, it will sound like you couldn’t make up your mind. Either use ti both times or te both times - IV6 to iv6: sounds cool, but funky because the bassline has an A2 in it. Funnily enough it goes really well with a bVII though - vi to bVI: IT SOUNDS GOOD! Cannot go wrong with The Batman Chord, especially as part of a deceptive cadence. Sounds epic</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> this last bit was an exercise in messing around and hearing different colors, not a model for how you should do assignments. Some of these swaps just sound really, really bad and/or are a nightmare to deal with.</p><p><em>Le</em> and <em>me</em> are going to be your most borrowed tones, though <em>le</em> is more common.</p><h2 id="class-discussion-19">Class discussion</h2><p><strong>Refresher: what is a pitch class (pc)?</strong> - A number to represent all enharmonic equivalents of a pitch. We use 0 to e - Remember 10 and 11 are represented as t and e</p><p><strong>Refresher: what is a pitch class set (pcs)?</strong> - A collection of pitch classes. Each group size has a different name (refer to the chart in 22b)</p><p><strong>Notating pitch class sets</strong> - Many of the examples on your homework will be <em>unordered</em> pitch class sets. Despite this name, we need a standard system for writing these so we can easily make them <em>ordered</em> later. - Undordered pc sets are notated with parantheses around the set and commas between each pc. Examples: (0,1,5,t) and (Bb,C,D,G). Like two points on a graph are notated before you actually graph them.</p><p><strong>Modulo 12 arithmetic</strong> - 12 is the magic number in this system! Everything is based around 12. Just like how you know that the clock resets when you go from noon to 1 P.M., the number above e/11 in this notation roll back around to 0, 1, 2, etc. - If you have a number above 12, you subtract 12 from it to get the number that’s actually within the bounds of our system.</p><p><strong>Notating transposition</strong> - We are solely in fixed zero now. - We have the pitch class set (E,F,G,Bb). Using traditional transposition methods, transpose up a P4 to get (A,Bb,C,Eb) - If we convert our first pcs to integer notation, we get (4,5,7,t). Add 5 to each number (subtracting 12 from any numbers over e), and we have (9,t,0,3). Convert the second set back to note names, and you will find it’s the same as the second set the first time we transposed in our traditional method. - The numbers in integer notation represent intervals from 0. 5 = P4 because F is a P4 (5 half steps) from C (0) - You would notate this process like this: T5(E,F,G,Bb) = (A,Bb,C,Eb) OR T5(4,5,7,t) = (9,t,0,3). T5 just means that we are transposing by adding 5, and it is fixed to the front of the original set to show that it is the one we’re manipulating.</p><p><strong>Transposing downward</strong> - Same process as above, but instead of adding numbers we subtract them! - In Mod12, you can also add 12 to a negative number to get a pc within the bounds of our notation system.</p><p><strong>Normal form/normal order</strong> - Normal form/order is an ascending arrangement of a pcs where the outside interval is smallest. This is very different from tertian harmony, where we’re concerned with stacking in thirds. - Let’s use (1,7,t). Think about this process like using a clock face: you can only go clockwise, which means you can shuffle which nubmer is first in the set as long as the set remains in the same order. You can have (7,t,1) but you can’t have (1,t,7) because t is out of ascending order. - We can have (1,7,t,), (7,t,1), or (t,1,7). We’re looking for the smallest outside interval, which we do by subtracting the last integer from the first one in the set. t-1=9, 1-7=6, and 7-t=9. Since the middle one has the smallest interval, the normal form for (1,7,t) is [7,t,1]. - Square brackets and commas denote normal form. - <em>Always</em> put things in ascending form before you put them in normal or prime form. This form allows us to go through the process of finding the smallest outside interval, so it’s important that we start out using it.</p><p><strong>Breaking ties for ordering pitch class sets</strong> - What do we do if we do all our subtracting and end up with two of the same result?? - Go one more number in from the right with the remaining possibilities to break the tie! Obviously there was no tie to break with (1,7,t), but if we wanted to break the tie between the two 9 answers we would go 7-1=6 and 1-t=3 respectively.</p><p><strong>Developing a method for normal form using (3,e,5,2,8)</strong> - Put in ascending order: (2,3,5,8,e). Any ascending order is fine, but I usually start with the smallest number on the left because it makes sure I don’t get mixed up - Get all our different ascending forms: - (2,3,5,8,e) - (3,5,8,e,2) - (5,8,e,2,3) - (8,e,2,3,5) - (e,2,3,5,8) - Subtract the outside numbers (last number - first number): - e-2=9 - 2-3=e - 3-5=t - 5-8=9 - 8-e=9 - Subtract the next smallest intervals for the tiebreakers (second to last number - first number): - 8-2=6 - 3-8=7 - 5-e=6 - Subtract the next smallest intervals for the second tiebreakers (third to last number - first number): - 5-2=3 - 3-e=4 -The normal form for this pentachord is [2,3,5,8,e]. Remember that we’re subtracting the same number every time–we’re just changing what we’re subtracting it <em>from</em></p><p>Completely symmetrical pitch class sets don’t have a normal form, so we would just write it in ascending form with the smallest number at the bottom.</p><h2 id="further-reading-8">Further reading</h2><h3 id="from-open-music-theory-9">From <em>Open Music Theory</em></h3><h4 id="transposition-1">Transposition</h4><p>In post-tonal music, transposition is often associated with motion: Take a chord, motive, melody, and when it is transposed, the aural effect is of <em>moving</em> that chord, motive, or melody in some direction.

Transposing something preserves its intervallic content, and not only that, it preserves the specific arrangement of that thing’s intervals. When we hear the passage at m. 18 above, we recognize its relationship to the passage in m. 1 because the same intervals return, but starting on a different pitch.</p><p>Transposition is an operation — something that is <em>done</em> to a pitch, pitch class, or collection of these things — or alternatively a <em>measurement</em> — representing the distance between things. We represent it as <em>Tn</em>, where <em>n</em> represents the ordered pitch-class interval between the two things. To transpose something by <em>Tn</em>, add <em>n</em> to every element in that thing (mod 12).

For example, E Phrygian is the same key signature as C major but starts on the third scale degree - If thinking in terms of what is altered from the original key is more helpful, you can instead think of E Phrygian as having a lowered 2, 3, 6, and 7.

There are only two unique whole tone collections: C D E F# G# A# and Db Eb F G A B. You can start on any of the notes within these collections, but the cycle of the two will be the same - There’s no possible center to a whole tone scale because there are six notes in it and they are all a whole step apart. This gives it its characteristic off-kilter feeling - Whole tone scale don’t have a standard mode of notation but will always have a diminished third somewhere - Another way to think of these is as two interlocking augmented triads. For example, with the first whole tone collection (C D E F# G# A#), it is made up of the two augmented triads C E G# and D F# A# - Pretty common in music because composers like to do cool and fancy stuff with them</p><p><strong>3+1 and 1+3 Hexatonic</strong> - Based on interval patterns. 3+1 trades off between a minor third and a half step between each note, and 1+3 trades off between a half step and a minor third between each note - The 3 actually means three half steps, but it may be easier to think of it as a minor third instead - These scales have 4 unique collections which you can look at in the textbook because I don’t want to write them all out here sorry - As an example, though, each collection can be used for either scale. Starting on a note that is followed by a half step, you start a 1+3 hexatonic scale. Starting on one followed by a minor third, you start a 3+1 hexatonic scale - We always label these scales in ascending form!!

Some of these scales, like the various diatonic <em>modes</em> and the pentatonic collection, are relatively familiar to most listeners. Others — such as octatonic, whole-tone, and acoustic collections/scales — are more novel, and usually (but not always) found in twentieth- and twenty-first-century compositions.</p><p>When characterizing many of these new musical resources, the word “collection” is often more appropriate than “scale.” A <em>collection</em> is a group of notes — usually five or more. Imagine a collection as a source from which a composer can draw musical material — a kind of “soup” within which pitch-classes float freely. Collections by themselves do not imply a tonal center. But in a composition a composer may establish a tonal center by privileging one note of the collection, which we then call a <em>scale</em>.</p><h4 id="diatonic-collection-modes">Diatonic Collection (modes)</h4><p>The <em>diatonic collection</em> is any transposition of the 7 white keys on the piano. Refer to these collections by the number of sharps and flats they contain: the “0-sharp” collection, the “1-sharp” collection, and so on. The “2-flat” collection, for example, contains the pitch classes {F, G, A, B-flat, C, D, E-flat}.</p><p>When these collections gain a tonic note, they morph into scales, which by tradition we name according to the “modal” system established in centuries ago. (Note that while these modes share their names with the modes of the Medieval Christian church, they function quite differently. The similarity is principally one of name.)</p><p>One way to look at these “modes” is to think of the seven white keys of the piano {C, D, E, F, A, B}. These notes, when starting on different pitches, create the different modal scales. By taking each note of the seven-white-key collection, and treating it as as the tonic, all seven modal scales can be played. Ionian treats C as tonic, Dorian treats D as tonic, Phrygian treats E as tonic, Lydian treats F as tonic, Mixolydian treats G as tonic, Aeolian treats A as tonic, and Locrian treats B as tonic:</p><p>Ionian mode (major scale): <em>do re mi fa sol la ti do</em></p><p><img src="images/postTonal/modes/ionian.png" alt="Ionian mode on the treble staff." style="width:75%; margin:auto;" /></p><p>Dorian mode: <em>do re me fa sol la te do</em></p><p><img src="images/postTonal/modes/dorian.png" alt="Dorian mode on the treble staff." style="width:75%; margin:auto;" /></p><p>Phrygian mode: <em>do ra me fa sol le te do</em></p><p><img src="images/postTonal/modes/phrygian.png" alt="Phrygian mode on the treble staff." style="width:75%; margin:auto;" /></p><p>Lydian mode: <em>do re mi fi sol la ti do</em></p><p><img src="images/postTonal/modes/lydian.png" alt="Lydian mode on the treble staff." style="width:75%; margin:auto;" /></p><p>Mixolydian mode: <em>do re mi fa sol la te do</em></p><p><img src="images/postTonal/modes/mixolydian.png" alt="Mixolydian mode on the treble staff." style="width:75%; margin:auto;" /></p><p>Aeolian mode (natural-minor scale): <em>do re me fa sol le te do</em></p><p><img src="images/postTonal/modes/aeolian.png" alt="Aeolian mode on the treble staff." style="width:75%; margin:auto;" /></p><p>Locrian mode (uncommon outside jazz): <em>do ra me fa se le te do</em></p><p><img src="images/postTonal/modes/locrian.png" alt="Locrian mode on the treble staff." style="width:75%; margin:auto;" /></p><p>Like the major and minor scales, these intervallic relationships can be transposed to any tonic pitch.</p><h4 id="pentatonic-collection">Pentatonic Collection</h4><p><em>Pentatonic collections</em> are five-note <em>subsets</em> of the diatonic collection. Here’s a quick way to create a pentatonic collection: (1) List the notes of a major scale. (2) Remove scale degress 4 and 7. (E.g., the pentatonic collection {C,D,E,G,A} corresponds to scale degrees 1,2,3,5,6 of the C major scale.)</p><p><img src="images/postTonal/pentatonicWhite.png" alt="White-key pentatonic scale on the treble staff." style="width:50%; margin:auto;" /></p><p>Removing scale degrees 4 and 7 results in a collection with no half steps. As a result of its “halfsteplessness,” any member of the collection easily functions as a tonal center. For example, given the 0-sharp pentatonic collection, there are five unique scales formed when each of the collection’s pitch classes become a tonic: C pentatonic (C,D,E,G,A), D pentatonic (D,E,G,A,C), E pentatonic (E,G,A,C,D), and so on.</p><p>The black keys on the piano also form a pentatonic collection:</p><p><img src="images/postTonal/pentatonicBlack.png" alt="Black-key pentatonic scale on the treble staff." style="width:50%; margin:auto;" /></p><h3 id="whole-tone-collection">Whole Tone Collection</h3><p>This is a group of notes generated entirely by whole tones: {0,2,4,6,8,10}, for example.</p><p><img src="images/postTonal/wholeTone.png" alt="C whole-tone scale on the treble staff." style="width:60%; margin:auto;" /></p><p>There are only two unique <em>whole-tone</em> collections. WT0 contains pitch classes {0,2,4,6,8,10}, while WT1 contains pitch classes {1,3,5,7,9,11}. In other words, WT0 contains the pitch classes {C, D, E, F-sharp, G-sharp, B-flat}, while WT1 contains pitch classes {C-sharp, D-sharp, F, G, A, B}.</p><h4 id="octatonic-collection">Octatonic Collection</h4><p>Called octatonic because it has eight pitch classes, the <em>octatonic collection</em> is full of compositional potential and has been used by many composers to a variety of ends. An octatonic collection is easily generated by alternating half steps and whole steps. Using pitch class numbers, one example is {0,1,3,4,6,7,9,10}.</p><p><img src="images/postTonal/octatonic.png" alt="C half-whole octatonic scale on the treble staff." style="width:75%; margin:auto;" /></p><p>The interval content of this collection is very homogenous, and this intervallic consistency leads to one of its most interesting properties. When we transpose the above collection by 3—adding 3 to each of the integers in the collection—{0,1,3,4,6,7,9,10} becomes {3,4,6,7,9,10,0,1}. Comparing the two shows that these collections are exactly the same! In fact, you would come up with the same collection if you transposed it by 6 or 9 as well.</p><p>Olivier Messiaen called such collections “modes of limited transposition.” (The whole-tone scale is also a mode of limited transposition.) And as a result of the property, there are only three unique octatonic collections. We name these arbitrarily as OCT(0,1), OCT(1,2), and OCT(2,3). The numbers to the right of “OCT” are pitch classes within that scale. (E.g., the {0,1,3,4,6,7,9,10} collection I discussed above is OCT(1,2).) We can also call them C–C♯ octatonic, C♯–D octatonic, and D–E♭ octatonic.</p><h4 id="other-collections-and-scales">Other Collections and Scales</h4><p>There are many, many other collections and scales used by composers and musicians in the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries. Messiaen, for example, described five more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_limited_transposition">modes of limited transposition</a>, and there are other smaller collections that have the same property. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_scale">Acoustic scales</a>, formed from the first seven unique partials of the overtone series, are common in the music of Debussy, Bartok, and Crumb — ocassionally as a representation of nature. Jazz musicians have an entire set of scales used for improvisation. Non-Western musics often have unique systems of scales and collections, such as the rāgas used in Indian classical music.</p><p>More generally, any large set of pitch classes that form the basis for a passage may function as a collection, even if it has no familiar name. Most often, music theorists refer to these collections with pitch-class set notation.</p><hr/><p><em>This resource was created by Brian Moseley and contains contributions from Meredith Cahill, Elise Campbell, and Kris Shaffer.</em></p><h2 id="class-discussion-21">Class discussion</h2><h2 id="further-reading-10">Further reading</h2><h3 id="from-open-music-theory-11">From Open Music Theory</h3><h4 id="periods">Periods</h4><p>A period is one type of theme, like the <a href="sentence.html">sentence</a>, common to the Classical style.</p><p>The period is generally eight measures long and contains two four-measure phrases, called <em>antecedent</em> and <em>consequent</em>.</p><p><img src="images/ClassicalThemes/period.svg" ></p><p>The period is characterized by balance and symmetry.

They show up naturally in minor keys. If we were to have a iv in a major key, that would be a chromatic chord. Any chord that is modified from how it would appear naturally in the major or minor key is chromatic.</p><p><strong>A standard progression: I - vi - ii - V - I (in C)</strong> - Remember: fa does <em>not</em> always go to mi. In this progression, if you have F and G in the alto voice for ii and V, fa should go to sol. This is because in circle-of-fifths progressions, thirds always resolve up to the root of the next chord.</p><p><strong>Altering ii - V</strong> - The mystery chords are V and I in G major. All we did was alter the key signature for the second two chords. The key signature is a stand-in for adding an accidental (raised third) to ii.</p><p><strong>Changing ii to a dominant chord</strong> - In order to get the same effect we got in the last example, we need to add an accidental. Raise the third in ii to get…a V/V! This is called <em>tonicization</em>. - Tonicization = extending harmony to treat any non-tonic chord as a tonic. Another way to think of this is just us temporarily creating a tonic. Remember, V/V - V movement is really just V - I in the key of V. - Slashes below the staff = “x <strong>of</strong> x.” Slashes above the staff = “x <strong>over</strong> x.” It can be confusing, but try not to mix them up! Remember that Roman numerals label function, whereas chord symbols label the actual notes within a chord. - Unlike tertiary function chords, secondary dominants <em>replace</em> function, rather than extend/embellish it. I6/4 is always paired with V because it extends dominant function, but V/x is always paired with x because we are temporarily going to x’s key area. One way to remember this is that we are temporarily phasing over to a <em>secondary</em> key.</p><p><strong>Do not</strong> tonicize ii0 in minor or vii0 ever. There is no diminished key and trying to do this for our part writing in this class is a bad idea. However, in analyses later in the semester you might see a composer do this because the Romantic period was really crazy.</p><p><strong>Secondary dominant seventh chords (same progression as before, but with ii7)</strong> - This process is the same as for turning a regular ii into a V/V, but we end up with a V7/V instead! - <em>How do I tell what inversion a secondary function chord is in?</em>: The inversion figures will always be attached to the Roman numeral to the left of the slash, as seen with V7/V. They go with the “upper” Roman numeral because the “lower” one is just a shorthand for a key in relation to the key we are already in. - As we’ll see in coming lectures, this process can used to tonicize any major or minor triad.</p><p><strong>How do we determine V/V in different keys?</strong> - Literally ask “what is the V of V” and go from there - Relate V/V to something you’re already very familiar with: ii! In a way, V/V is really just a fancy ii. They share the same root and usually share the same function. The only difference is V/V’s raised third - If thinking about solfege works better for you, you can use the above point but think about sol and re instead. If you see re and fi together, you’ll know it’s likely a V/V - These chords are weird and require added accidentals so double-checking (or even triple-checking) them is always a good idea!!

Since all three upper voices must be played by a single hand, they should never span more than an octave.</p><p>The melody always has an upward-pointing stem. Alto and tenor share a downward-pointing stem. If the alto and tenor share a note, that note receives a single downward-pointing stem. (See m. 1 of the example below.) If melody and alto share a note, that notehead is double-stemmed. (See m. 4 of the example below.)</p><p><a href="images/BCModel.png"><img src="images/BCModel.png" /></a></p><p>When choosing the notes to place in the upper voices above a figured bass, use the bass and figures to determine the pitch classes present in the chord. (When realizing an <em>unfigured bass</em>, you must determine appropriate figures before realizing.) If the chord is a four-note chord, use each chord member once, including the bass (exceptions will be noted later). If a chord has three pitch-classes (a triad, for instance), use each pitch-class once, and “double” one of them according to the following principles:</p><ul><li>If the figure is 6/4, 5/3, or other chord of the fifth, double the bass pitch class.<br />
</li><li>If the figure is 6/3 and the bass is a <em>fixed scale degree</em> (<em>do</em>, <em>re</em>, <em>fa</em>, or <em>sol</em>), double the bass pitch class.<br />
</li><li>If the figure is 6/3 and the bass is a <em>variable scale degree</em> (<em>mi</em>/<em>me</em>, <em>la</em>/<em>le</em>, or <em>ti</em>/<em>te</em>) or a chromatically altered pitch, double one of the upper voices at the octave or unison.<br />
</li><li>Generally, do not double a variable scale degree or a chromatically altered pitch.</li></ul><h4 id="tendency-tones">Tendency tones</h4><p>A <em>tendency tone</em> is a pitch (class)—usually represented as a scale degree—that tends to progress to some pitch classes more than others. Sometimes this tendency is absolute within a style, but more often it is context-dependent.</p><p>The most prominent tendency tones in Western tonal styles are <em>ti</em> (not <em>te</em>) and <em>le</em> (not <em>la</em>).</p><p>Generally speaking, when <em>ti</em> appears it tends to be followed by <em>do</em> in the same voice. In a harmonic context, this tendency is strongest when <em>ti</em> occurs in a dominant-functioning chord, and the “resolution” of that tendency comes upon change of function (to tonic or predominant).</p><p>Likewise, when <em>le</em> appears, it tends to be followed by <em>sol</em> in the same voice. This tendency is less dependent on function.</p><p>Exceptions to these tendencies include:</p><ul><li>When <em>ti</em> is in the middle of a stepwise descent (<em>re</em>–<em>do</em>–<em>ti</em>–<em>la</em>–<em>sol</em>, for example), it can progress down by step. (Note that <em>step inertia</em> here diminishes the effect of an “unresolved” tendency tone. Because there are two conflicting tendencies in play, in this case, either can be “resolved” unproblematically.)<br />
</li><li>When <em>ti</em> is in an inner voice, it can progress down to <em>sol</em> if necessary to accomplish good voice-leading in the other voices and ensure complete chords. This is called a <em>frustrated leading-tone</em>.<br />
</li><li>When <em>ti</em> is a functional dissonance of a tonic-functioning chord (see below) it should progress down by step.</li></ul><h4 id="functional-dissonances">Functional dissonances</h4><p>Some tendencies, such as the tendency for <em>le</em> to progress down, are relatively context-independent. Others are heavily contextualized. The primary contextual tendency for how melodic notes progress is the concept of <em>functional dissonance</em>.</p><p>Keep in mind from the <a href="harmonicFunctions.html">Harmonic functions resource</a> that chords tend to cluster in one of three functional groups (<strong>T</strong>, <strong>P</strong>, or <strong>D</strong>) When pitches fuse into a chord expressing one of these three functions, the pitches that comprise that have certain tendencies of progression that they may or may not have in other contexts.</p><p>Following are the scale degrees which act as dissonances for their respective functions:</p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th style="text-align: right;">function</th><th style="text-align: center;">dissonances</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: right;">T or Tx</td><td style="text-align: center;">7, 5 when 6 is also present</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: right;">P</td><td style="text-align: center;">3, 1 when 2 is also present</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: right;">D</td><td style="text-align: center;">4, 6</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In purely diatonic music (triads and seventh chords, no chromatics), these will include <em>the seventh of every seventh chord</em>, <em>the fifth of viiº or VII</em> (<em>fa</em>), and <em>the fifth of III or iii</em> (<em>ti/te</em>).</p><p>Keep in mind that only sometimes do these functional dissonances express themselves in chords or intervals that are acoustically dissonant. However, they do introduce a degree of tension that, like an acoustically dissonant interval in species counterpoint, requires a smooth introduction and a specific resolution.</p><p>When one of these scale degrees is present in a chord with the corresponding function, the dissonant scale degree has a strong tendency to <em>resolve down by step over the next change in function</em>. In strict composition, we will <em>always</em> follow these tendencies.</p><p>In strict keyboard style, these functional dissonances should be “prepared” (approached) by common tone or by step. Thus, though they are proper members of the chord, melodically they will look like one of the three dissonance types of species counterpoint: a <em>passing tone</em> or <em>neighbor tone</em> dissonance that is approached by step, or a <em>suspension</em> dissonance that is approached by a common tone. The suspension type is preferred.</p><p>Once a functional dissonance is introduced, it must be resolved down by step in the same voice when the function changes. The dissonance can also be <em>transferred</em> to another voice before resolution—for instance, if there are multiple chords in a row exhibiting the same function, a dissonance that appears in the alto can be transferred to the tenor in the following chord, and then resolve in the tenor when the function changes. (It is more typical, and smoother sounding, to transfer dissonances between inner voices or from an inner voice to an outer voice than from an outer voice to an inner voice. Once a dissonance appears in the melody or bass, where it is more noticeable, it tends to resolve in that voice.)</p><p>Functional dissonance resolutions often cause conflicts with other principles of voice leading. Except in special cases such as <em>schemata</em> (standard patterns that are common enough to sound appropriate, even if they follow different rules), the functional dissonance resolution takes precedence over other principles such as the <em>law of the shortest way</em>, contrary motion with the bass, and preferring common tones and steps to melodic leaps. A dissonance resolution is never an excuse for illegal parallels, and only rarely will lead to non-standard doublings.</p><p>Seventh chords are most easily thought of as an extension of triads, and our labeling system reflects this. In the same that we create a triad by stacking two 3rds, we create a seventh chord by adding another 3rd on <em>top</em> of a triad. They are called seventh chords because this new pitch creates an interval of a 7th between the chordal root and the new pitch.</p><p>{% capture ex1 %}X:1 %%staffsep 100% T:Diatonic Seventh Chords in the Major Scale M:C L:1/2 K:C [CEGB] [DFAc]| [EGBd] [FAce]| [GBdf] [Aceg]| [Bdfa] [cegb]|| w:MM mm mm MM Mm mm dm{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“1” abc=ex1 %}</p><p>Because they are stacked thirds, seventh chords are still considered tertian harmony. They are prevalent in almost all styles of Western music, and we have developed many systems to describe how they <em>function</em> harmonically. Again though, we must first be able to classify and label them in an structural manner that does not rely on key-based functions. We name the chord members by the distance above the bottom pitch <strong>when the chord is stacked in thirds</strong>: - the lowest pitch is called the <em>root</em> of the chord - the pitch that is a 3rd above the root is called the <em>chordal third</em> - the pitch that is a 5th above the root is called the <em>chordal fifth</em> - the pitch that is a 7th above the root is called the <em>chordal seventh</em></p><h4 id="seventh-chord-inversions">Seventh chord inversions</h4><p>All seventh chords have exactly four unique notes, although certain chord members can occasionally be omitted (and therefore implied) depending on the context.

The first word represents the quality of the base triad on which the seventh chord is built (e.g. major triad on bottom), and the second word describes the interval between the root and the chordal seventh. This description explains the nature of the pedagogical categorization–it mixes a chord quality with an interval quality. The first word always describes the triad (the bottom three pitches) while the second word describes the <em>interval quality</em> between the root and the seventh chordal member. This interval is always assumed to be a 7th.</p><ul><li>Major major (major seventh chord): major triad + M7</li><li>Major minor (dominant seventh chord): major triad + m7</li><li>Minor minor (minor seventh chord): minor triad + m7</li><li>Diminished minor (half-diminished seventh chord): diminished triad + m7</li><li>Diminished diminished (fully-diminished seventh chord): diminished triad + d7</li></ul><p>Building on your knowledge of inversion figures from triads, it should be possible to derive the seventh chord system. Like triad inversions, they: - use the intervals above the <em>bass</em>, not the <em>root</em> of the chord. - are written in superscript next to your chord quality (or Roman numeral when we get there). - have abbreviated versions that will be used rather than writing out every interval</p><p>There are four possible inversions for seventh chords. Below, you will find their abbreviated forms (most commonly used) and their full interval forms in parentheses. Remember that when written by hand or in music notation software, you will stack the numbers and <em>not</em> include a slash between them. - Root position: 7 (7/5/3) - First Inversion: 6/5 (6/5/3) - Second Inversion: 4/3 (6/4/3) - Third Inversion: 4/2 (6/4/2)</p><p>As a reminder, we will be using the term <em>inversion figure</em> to discuss this shorthand method of identifying inversions. Other systems refer to these same superscript numbers as figured bass, bass position Symbols, or figures, but we need not argue about which name is better. As long as the student understands the difference between <em>inversion figures</em>, true <em>figured bass</em> (i.e. Baroque system for writing keyboard harmonies), and the shorthand used in <em>leadsheet notation</em>, it will make no difference in your effectiveness.</p><p>Exercises in strict voice-leading, or species counterpoint, begin with a single, well formed musical line called the <em>cantus firmus</em> (fixed voice, or fixed melody; pl. <em>cantus firmi</em>). <em>Cantus firmus</em> composition gives us the opportunity to examine the following fundamental musical traits:</p><ul><li>smoothness<br />

As with all historical studies, especially those that are spread across a continent over decades, there are inconsistencies between systems and styles. We will look at a simplified version of contrapuntal writing to focus our thoughts on melodic interaction, however I urge you to complete a full study of counterpoint at some point in your musical development in order to properly explore this critical facet of music.

A strong melody will have a clear beginning, middle, and end, so having multiple climaxes muddies this journey. - Leaps should be used sparingly, because too many leaps imply certain types of harmony that were not common in this style. - Leaps should always be aproached and left by step, preferably in contrary motion. - You may sometimes leap to or from the climax.</p><h4 id="harmonic-intervals-and-structure">Harmonic intervals and structure</h4><ul><li>1:1 counterpoint will likely start and end on a perfect octave (or unison) of the tonic pitch, although a perfect fifth can be used to begin the counterpoint if necessary.</li><li>In this style of counterpoint, perfect intervals should only be approached by contrary or oblique motion, although oblique motion is not allowed in first species.

After that discussion, we will see if this concept makes more sense.</p><h4 id="describing-compound-time-signatures">Describing compound time signatures</h4><p>For a <em>compound</em> time signature: - the top number is how many divisions are in the meter. - the bottom number is the rhythmic value of the division.</p><p>These definitions may take quite a few tries for you to reach on your own, because students often focus on making compound time signatures fit the same mold as simple time signatures. It is easy to be careless with your use of the terms <em>beat, division</em>, and <em>subdivision</em>, but these three terms are the keys to separating compound from simple meters and their time signatures. In a simple meter time signature, the top number represents the number of <em>beats</em> in the measure, and the bottom number is the <em>note value</em> of the beat. Contrast that with compound meter time signatures. The top and bottom numbers represent entirely different concepts, and for compound meters, this requires a slight bit of math to find the actual number of beats. - To find the number of beats in a compound time signature, divide the top number by 3.</p><p>This highlights a fundamental issue in teaching our time signature system. It requires the musician to already understand the system by being able to differentiate between simple and compound meters, because the system is not uniform across all meters. This is why the pedagogical method of grouping meters by <em>simple</em> vs <em>compound</em> and then attaching a word to denote the number of beats (i.e. single, duple, triple, quadruple, etc.) is useful.</p><h4 id="duple-triple-and-quadruple-1">Duple, Triple, and Quadruple:</h4><p>The terms duple, triple, and quadruple refer to the number of beats in the measure. In compound time: - duple has 2 strong beats with 3 eighth notes per beat. - ex: 6/8 - triple has 3 strong beats with 3 eighth notes per beat. - ex: 9/8 - quadruple has 4 strong beats with 3 eighth notes per beat. - ex: 12/8</p><p>Within a given meter classification, there are many different time signatures. For example, in compound duple, there is 6/8, 6/16, 6/4, and many others.</p><h4 id="differentiating-between-compound-and-simple-meters">Differentiating between compound and simple meters</h4><p>The simplest and most accurate method for differentiating the various meters is to memorize the standard groupings of all meters. That being said it is fairly easy to remember that if the top number of the time signature is a multiple of three, then that is a compound meter, assuming that the tempo does not become slow or fast enough that that the listener hears a different grouping of the beat.</p><h4 id="theoretically-ideal-rhythmic-notation-in-compound-time">“Theoretically ideal” rhythmic notation in compound time</h4><p>Like simple time, theoretically ideal rhythmic notation in compound time does not obscure beats. Unlike simple time, compound time is written this way in common practice with few exceptions.</p><p>The most notable exception, though, occurs regularly enough that we should expect it. Occasionally a compound meter will create hemiola–a feel of two against three–by having three consecutive groups of two divisions over two compound beats. The most common notation of this occurs in 6/8 when three quarter notes are placed in a row. If written using quarter notes rather than tying two eighth notes together, this will obscure the second beat. The tune “America” from <em>West Side Story</em> highlights this rhythm as its primary melodic motif.</p><h4 id="beat-counting">Beat counting</h4><p>As with simple meters, there are various systems for counting beats and their divisions. One of the most common systems condenses the method for counting beats in simple time to 1-&amp;-a. The other most common counting method uses 1-la-li. For this course, we will use the -la-li method to help differentiate the counting from a simple meter.</p><p>The problem with both of these systems is that there is not a unique syllable for each subdivsion. Generally speaking, students are asked to insert “ta” between each of the division syllables creating 1-ta-la-ta-li-ta. This is adequate for practice aloud, but it is poor for specificity because there are three ‘ta’ syllables in each beat. For our class, we use: 1-to-la-ta-li-ti</p><h3 id="meters-that-have-a-3-as-the-top-number-of-the-time-signature">Meters that have a ‘3’ as the top number of the time signature</h3><p>After listening the two examples in 3/4, it is easy to identify that the two examples were identical except for the tempo. In the slower example, you will likely hear it in a simple triple meter with the quarter note as the beat. For the faster example, most instead hear this as a fast compound single meter with the dotted half note as the beat. Meters such as 3/8, 3/4, and 3/2 are all dependent on tempo as to whether they are a compound or simple meter. While a good rule of thumb is to consider these meters as simple until you have listened to the piece at tempo, 3/8 meters are commonly fast and conducted in one. Make sure to look at the tempo if determining a meter’s classification when only looking at the score.</p><p>If we think back on our progression through the course thus far, we began by studying individual pitches, then combined those pitches into intervals, and then assembled those intervals sequentially and simultaneously to create melodies and chords respectively. Next, we studied a simplified version of counterpoint in order to examine how the combined vertical and horizontal aspects of music interact to create basic tonality. While counterpoint provides a framework for understanding harmony, it is primarily a study of how the horizontal aspect of music, melody, combines and <em>implies</em> harmony; it does not establish the vertical aspect of music, harmony, as a standalone concept.</p><p>Therefore, we can use a simple counterpoint exercise to begin determining how harmony functions, because harmony is defined by the melodic tendencies of certain pitches within a diatonic scale.</p><h3 id="implied-harmony-in-two-parts">Implied harmony in two parts</h3><p><strong>Each measure of the next example implies the same two harmonies repeatedly–one on the first half note and the second on the second half note.</strong> - Which two harmonies do you think these measures imply? - What are the Roman numerals and inversion figures for each measure? - Is there more than one option for any of the harmonies? - Are all the intervals consonant? - If not, to which chords do the dissonant intervals belong?<br />

They have a strong tonal gravity pulling toward a <em>tonic</em> harmony - This includes the V and vii<sup>o</sup> chords. - <em>Pre-dominant</em> (<strong>P</strong>) harmonies are weak and unstable. Their tonal gravity pulls them toward <em>dominant</em> harmonies. - This includes the ii and IV chords, but can occasionally include the vi chord. - Note that there is a difference between the words “pre-dominant” and “predominant.”</p><h4 id="some-caveats-on-making-assumptions-based-on-this-exercise">Some caveats on making assumptions based on this exercise</h4><p>You may be tempted to make some definitive conclusions about voice-leading from looking at these examples–such as <code>ti</code> resolving to <code>do</code>, or <code>fa</code> resolving to <code>mi</code>–but be careful not to over-generalize with these ideas. If you make the assumption that <code>ti</code> always resolves to <code>do</code> without considering the context, you will make errors in situations where <code>ti</code> is not part of a dominant function. We will explore the true nature of tendency tones and their resolution in the next unit.</p><p>You may also notice that the chordal fifth is the least common chordal member in these examples, and as we will see when we begin voicing four-part harmony, the chordal fifth is indeed expendable. The root and third are best at implying a harmony, and the chordal seventh adds a strong resolution, whereas the fifth only provides a “fullness” to the chord. But not <em>all</em> chordal fifths are easily expendable, and sometimes composers will choose to imply/omit a chordal third (or even root!) given a particularly context. We will explore all of these ideas further in our part-writing studies.</p><h3 id="cadences-1">Cadences</h3><p>Because of the importance of the V-I progression, we will introduce an important term in understanding harmony: the <em>cadence</em>. We will explore cadences further in the Unit 8, but for now, you may think of a cadence as a harmonic progression used to conclude a musical phrase. There are many types of cadences, but all of the progressions above are <em>authentic cadences</em>–cadences that have a V chord moving to a I chord. Bass movement is a key factor in determining the strength of a cadence. For example, measures 1 and 3 in the examples likely sound stronger to you than the last measure. The last measure not only lacks <code>sol</code> to <code>do</code> in the bass, it also does not have a tonic in the final chord. We will return to this idea when discussing cadences in detail in Unit 8a.</p><p>N/A yet</p><p>Neapolitan chord and augmented sixth chords act as functional substitutions for pre-dominant chords, although we looked at how they could be used to substitute for dominant chords as well. The chord that you will study below does not fulfill one of the three primary functions; instead, it is used to embellish and elongate a function.</p><p>It is possible to think of this chord using tertian harmony, but its voice-leading determines its construction.</p><p>Listen to and then analyze the following three progressions. The first is the most straightforward example of this chord, and each example gets progressively more complicated. As always, start your analysis with leadsheet symbols and then provide Roman numerals when possible. In each progression, study the chromatic chord to answer the following questions: - How would you describe its construction? - How does it function? (e.g. tonic, passing, etc.) - Does it have tendency tones, and if so, how do they resolve? - If you were to compare it to a diatonic or chromatic chord that normally fulfills this function, which chord shares the most commonalities with it? - Does this embellishing chord work for all types of chords (i.e. major, minor, etc.)? If not, why?</p><p>{% capture ex1 %}X:1 T:Using the common-tone diminished chord M:4/4 L:1/2 Q:1/4=90 K:C V:1 [cE] [BF]| [cE] [GE]| [A^D] [GE]| [BF] [cE]|] [cE] [cE]| [dF] [dF]| [^cE] [dF]| [c2E]|] [cE] [cE]| [dD] [d^E]| [d^F] [d=F]| [c2E]|] V:2 clef=bass [C,G,] [G,,G,]| [G,C,] [G,C,]| [^F,C,] [G,C,]| [D,G,] [G,C,]|] w:C: [C,G,] [A,,A,]| [F,,A,] [G,,B,]| [G,,^A,] [G,,B,]| [G,2C,2]|] w:C: [C,G,] [A,,A,]| [^F,,A,] [^G,,B,]| [A,,C] [B,G,,]| [G,2C,2]|] w:C:{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“1” abc=ex1 %}</p><h4 id="conclusions-29">Conclusions</h4><p>Each of these three examples contains one chord which does not function like any chord that we have studied thus far. - The first example is mostly straight-forward; it establishes the key through a I-V-I progression and then begins arpeggiating the I chord. On the downbeat of the the third measure, however, a diminished seventh chord appears that does not function as any diminished seventh chord we have seen. Usually, a diminished seventh chord is a dominant function of the chord that it precedes. In this case, we have D#<sup>o7</sup>, which, if it were a secondary leading-tone chord, would resolve to a chord with the root of an E–in this key, it would likely be a vii<sup>o7</sup>/iii. Instead, it goes back to the I chord. The notable features of this resolution though, are that three of the pitches resolve smoothly by step-wise motion to the pitches of the I chord while the last pitch is a common-tone between the two chords. You could analyze this as an entire chord that functions as both neighbor tones and a pedal tone, but that does not truly describe its function. So what is this #ii<sup>o7</sup>? - In the second example, we find the same chord on the downbeat of the third measure, but in this example, it is embellishing the V chord instead of the I chord. It shares the same voice-leading principles as the previous example did with the I chord–three neighbor tones and one common tone–as the previous example, but instead of being built as #ii<sup>o7</sup>, it is now a #vi<sup>o7</sup> that decorates a V chord. - The last example is the most complicated. The progression begins with a I chord moving to a vi chord, but instead of going to a diatonic predominant, it moves to a V<sup>6</sup>/V. This does not go directly to a V chord, however, and instead passes through a strange diminished seventh chord on the beat 3 of the second measure, an E#<sup>o7</sup>. While the neighbor tones of the previous example are slightly altered in this case in that they all of our neighbor tones are now passing tones. The chord still has many commonalities to the previous examples, though, in that it is still a diminished seventh chord that is surrounded by the same harmony on both sides and it shares a common-tone with those chords.</p><h3 id="common-tone-diminished-chords">Common-tone diminished chords</h3><p>Each of the chromatic chords above is an example of <em>common-tone diminished chord</em>. You will label these chords as <strong>ct<sup>o7</sup></strong>.</p><p>Common-tone diminished chords: - Are stacks of minor thirds which creates a fully diminished seventh chord. - When you encounter these in an analysis, you will likely assume that it is a secondary leading-tone chord, but you will quickly notice that it does not resolve correctly. - Can be used to embellish <em>any</em> major triad or dominant seventh chord. - ct<sup>o7</sup> most often embellish either I or V (and V<sup>7</sup>). - These chords do not work well for non-major triads because there will be more than one common tone. For example, a minor triad would have two common tones with its ct<sup>o7</sup>, and this weakens the voice leading. - Share a common tone with the root of the chord to which they resolve. - It is common for the same chord to precede the ct<sup>o7</sup>, but not a requirement. - The three non-common tones will resolve by step to the closest chord tone. - For major triads, this means that the chordal fifth will likely need to be doubled. - For dominant seventh chords, each non-common tone resolves by half-step to the closest chord tone. - Do not have their own primary function (i.e. tonic, dominant, pre-dominant) and instead elongate another chord’s function. - Are always labeled with only <sup>o7</sup>. - They have no standard inversion, so they do not require an inversion figure. As with all fully diminished seventh chords, they can be enharmonically spelled in four different ways, and the voice leading of the passage will determine how the chord should be spelled. - The two most common ct<sup>o7</sup> chords are those that embellish the I and V chords. These will most likely be spelled as #ii<sup>o7</sup> and #vi<sup>o7</sup> respectively, because these provide the correct voice leading.</p><p>As discussed repeatedly in this course, diatonic harmony and its progressions work because of the strength of the voice-leading. To prove this, let’s listen to the following standard progression. As you listen, pay special attention to the voice-leading. Do you consider this progression to have strong voice-leading? If so, what makes it strong? If not, what makes it weak and what could strengthen it?</p><p>{% capture ex1 %}X:1 T:Basic diatonic progression M:4/4 L:1 K:C V:1 [EG]| [EA]| [FA]| [BG]| [cG]|] V:2 clef=bass [C,C]| [A,,C]| [D,D]| [G,,D]| [C,E]|] w:C:I vi ii V I{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“1” abc=ex1 %}</p><p>Most students when presented with these questions determine that the strength of the progression comes from three things: - The overall smoothness of the voice-leading in the upper voices - The “pull” from certain tendency tones toward another - The strong, repetitive pattern of the bass voice</p><p>Between any two chords with roots separated by descending P5, there is one common tone and two voices that resolve by step.

In the simplified progression above, count the half-steps necessary to move between each of the two chords. Which chords have the smoothest voice-leading? Which are the most disjunct? Does this line up with what you would have expected?</p><h3 id="idealized-voice-leading-intervals-ivi">Idealized Voice-leading Intervals (IVI)</h3><p>Counting the half-steps necessary for resolution in idealized voice-leading will be helpful to us as we explore more advanced harmonic concepts, because it gives us a tool to quantify something that is relatively subjective–what makes good voice-leading. We will call this process Idealized Voice-leading Intervals (IVI). You can do this between any two chords by: - Writing both chords next to each other in closed position. - Inverting one of the chords to minimize the distance necessary to resolve the two chords. - Counting the half-steps necessary to resolve the progression.</p><p>When counting the half-steps in the the above progression, you hopefully found that the movement from ii to V was the “weakest” voice-leading and required four half-steps to resolve. The next strongest resolutions were vi to ii and V to I. Both of these resolutions require only three half-steps. But in a surprise twist, the winner of the smoothest voice-leading in the above progression, was not a standard function progression at all; it was the I chord moving to the vi chord to start the progression. This happens because it has <em>two</em> common tones rather than just the one associated with chords that have roots separated by P5.</p><h3 id="mediant-harmony">Mediant harmony</h3><p>Let’s take this one step further. Before reading on, take a moment to find the IVI between a <strong>C major triad</strong> and all triads that are <strong>diatonic to C major or C minor</strong>.* Rank them in order of smoothest voice-leading to least.</p><p>As you can see the smoothest voice-leading possible between a C major triad and a different triad is the one half-step necessary to create E minor, the mediant. In the next closest category (two half-steps), there are three chords: A minor (the submediant), A-flat major (the borrowed submediant), and F minor (the borrowed subdominant). Of the four smoothest chords, three are chords whose roots are separated by a third.</p><p>Anytime a progression has two chords whose roots are separated by a M3 or a m3, we call this <em>mediant harmony</em>. (Do not confuse this with tertian harmony; tertian harmony is any harmony that uses chords built by stacking thirds. This has nothing to do with the root movement within a progression.) Rather than the structured rules and tendency tones of standard diatonic harmony, mediant harmony relies on the smoothness of voice-leading between two chords to create interesting new colors and progressions within a somewhat tonal framework.</p><h3 id="finding-and-labeling-mediants">Finding and labeling mediants</h3><p>For any major or minor triad, there are eight possible mediant chords: one major and one minor chord for each of the four mediant pitches. For example, the four mediant pitches for C are E (mediant), E-flat (borrowed mediant), A (submediant), and A-flat (borrowed submediant). Each of these four pitches can have either a major or minor chord built off of it for a total of eight possible mediant chords.</p><p>Before looking at the completed chart below, find the IVI for each of the eight possible chords. After you group the mediants by IVI, also note how many common tones there are between the C major and each chord.</p><h4 id="conclusions-30">Conclusions</h4><p>All mediant harmonies for a C major triad:</p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Diatonic mediants</th><th>Chromatic mediant</th><th>Doubly chromatic mediants</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>E minor</td><td>E major</td><td>E-flat minor</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>A minor</td><td>A major</td><td>A-flat minor</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>–</td><td>E-flat major</td><td>–</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>–</td><td>A-flat major</td><td>–</td></tr></tbody></table><p>There are three categories of mediants.

It will not sound like a standard diatonic progression, but at the same time, it will likely sound like a convincing modulation from a C major chord to a B-flat major chord. You may even hear the last two chords as a cadence. Is it possible for you to analyze this using normal Roman numeral analysis?</p><p>{% capture ex3 %}X:3 T:Mediant progression M:4/4 L:1 K:C V:1 [CEG]| [C_E_A]| [CF_A]| [CFA]| [DFA]| [DF_B]|] w:Cmaj Abmaj Fmin Fmaj Dmin Bbmaj{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“3” abc=ex3 %}</p><p>In this progression, Roman numerals cease to have a meaningful role because the chords do not follow standard function. What good is using Roman numerals if a iii chord can function directly before the tonic chord? You <em>could</em> label this passage as beginning in C major and moving through I-bVI-iv, and you would then need to pivot on the F major chord to become the V chord in B-flat major. You could even analyze the D minor chord as just the arrival of the B-flat major triad with a retardation on the A.</p><p>But none of this truly explains why this works. In passages like these– those that rely more on an interesting pattern of voice-leading rather than standard function–I recommend writing Roman numerals under each chord in order to give an approximation of what key you are hearing, but also putting an IVI number between each pair of chords. I would analyze the above passage as:</p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Key</th><th>Chord 1</th><th>Chord 2</th><th>Chord 3</th><th>Chord 4</th><th>Chord 5</th><th>Chord 6</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>C:</td><td>I [IVI:2]</td><td>bVI6 [IVI:2]</td><td>iv6/4 [IVI:1]</td><td>IV6/4 [IVI:2]</td><td>—–</td><td>—–</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Bb:</td><td>—–</td><td>—–</td><td>—–</td><td>V6/4 [IVI:2]</td><td>iii [IVI:1]</td><td>I</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="the-limits-of-ivi">The limits of IVI</h3><p>As with all tools, you must be careful with how you use Idealized Voice-leading Intervals and mediant harmony. For example, when looking at diatonic progressions, the order in which the chords appear matters as much as the smoothness of the voice-leading. If you try to resolve V to ii, you have created a regression that will likely sound displeasing to someone familiar with tonal harmony. Also, many would say that adding a seventh to a chord (e.g. V becoming V7) strengthens the progression, because we have added a second tendency tone and therefore more tonal gravity between the two chords. But if you were to only look at IVI, adding the seventh would <em>weaken</em> the progression because it adds an extra half-step of resolution. In general, IVI is most useful when looking at non-standard tonal progressions.</p><p>Transposition is the most commonly used set manipulation, but there is a second commonly used function that is of equal importance to understanding pc sets.</p><h3 id="inversion">Inversion</h3><p>When first studying tonal harmony, we discussed the scale degree names in pairs: dominant/subdominant, mediant/submediant, subtonic/supertonic. For each of these pairs, there is a duality to their naming in that they share a relationship centered around the tonic pitch. For example, the dominant is a P5 <em>above</em> the tonic where the subdominant is a P5 <em>below</em> the tonic. They are mirrored around the central pitch, and therefore represent an <em>inversion</em> of each other.</p><p>In set theory, we can perform this same operation using intervals (i.e. numbers of half-steps). Take a moment to think about how to translate the concept of inversion from traditional intervals (e.g. P5,M3) into pitch-class integers. What kind of results do you expect for integer notation? Remember that to find an inversion of any musical pitch, you need two pieces of information: the starting pitch class and the pitch class <em>around</em> which you will invert.</p><h3 id="visually-inverting-pitch-classes">Visually inverting pitch classes</h3><p>Depending on the central pitch used to invert, pitch-class integer notation can make inversion relatively easy. It does not require you to understand a specialized pitch and interval system like traditional notation. Instead, it only requires basic mathematical functions.</p><p>Before tackling the mathematical approach to inverting pitch-class integers, let’s visually explore inversion using the pitch class continuum below. For simplicity’s sake, let’s start by centering our inversions around C/0. To visually find an inversion, pick a letter/integer on the chart below. Count the number of steps it takes to reach C/0, and then continue past C/0 for the same number of steps. (You can think of it as balancing the scale.) Of course, you will find that each positive integer is paired with its negative integer; 5 becomes -5, 8 becomes -8, etc. If you were to create a chart showing all inversion pairs as letter names, what patterns do you notice about the pairings? For example, how does the 7/-7 pair compare to the 5/-5 pair? Also, what is the inversion for C/0? Why?</p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>-e</th><th>-t</th><th>-9</th><th>-8</th><th>-7</th><th>-6</th><th>-5</th><th>-4</th><th>-3</th><th>-2</th><th>-1</th><th>0</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th><th>6</th><th>7</th><th>8</th><th>9</th><th>t</th><th>e</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>C#</td><td>D</td><td>D#</td><td>E</td><td>F</td><td>F#</td><td>G</td><td>G#</td><td>A</td><td>A#</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>C#</td><td>D</td><td>D#</td><td>E</td><td>F</td><td>F#</td><td>G</td><td>G#</td><td>A</td><td>A#</td><td>B</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Your first chart should have 12 pc sets, although two of them are technically only one pitch name – C/0 and F#/6 end up inverting on top of themselves meaning that they are monads. However, as you look at the pairs, do you see a pattern? How many <em>unique</em> pc sets are there if you only look at pitch letter names?</p><h3 id="applying-mod12">Applying Mod12</h3><p>As you hopefully can see, there are only six <em>unique</em> inversion pairs once you eliminate duplicates by examining pitch letters. However, when we instead look at the pitch-class integers, you still have 12 unique pc sets because negative numbers differentiate the sets. You have just demonstrated the importance of using Mod12 to simplify all pc sets to only include integers between 0 and 11. (This is also a visual demonstration of how <em>octave equivalency</em> works.) If you look at the chart below, you can see what happens when we apply Mod12 to a series of integers; it creates a continuously repeating set of integers between 0 and 11, which means that inversion is as simple as memorizing six pairs…as long as you are using fixed zero/six as your inversion axis. If you decide to invert around a different pitch class, you will end up with six different pairs.</p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>-e</th><th>-t</th><th>-9</th><th>-8</th><th>-7</th><th>-6</th><th>-5</th><th>-4</th><th>-3</th><th>-2</th><th>-1</th><th>0</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th><th>6</th><th>7</th><th>8</th><th>9</th><th>t</th><th>e</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>t</td><td>e</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>t</td><td>e</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This means that the inversion pairs when inverting around zero (and 6) are:</p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Inversion Pair 1</th><th>Inversion Pair 2</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>1</td><td>e</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>2</td><td>t</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>3</td><td>9</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>4</td><td>8</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>5</td><td>7</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>6</td><td>6</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Because mod12 creates a continuously repeating series of 12 integers, you may use the visual aid of a clock to help you find inversions. First, draw a clock (with 0 in the place of 12). Then draw a line between 0 and 6; this line will represents the center around which you will invert your pitches. To find your inversion pairs, connect the integers by a line that is perpendicular to the center line (i.e. integers that are directly across the line), and you will see that you create the same set of inversion pairs above. If you were to move your center line to connect a different set of opposites, say 2 and 8, what would this represent?</p><h3 id="finding-inversions-mathematically">Finding inversions mathematically</h3><p>As with transposition, we have shorthand to represent inversion.

If not, why are they different? Which do you think is correct? Why?</p><h3 id="the-shortcut">The shortcut</h3><p>Inverting first will always give you the correct answer, because in that case you are inverting <em>around zero</em> and then transposing. If you transpose first, you are actually inverting around a different axis. You can think of this easily using the clock face. If you invert first, you invert around the 0/6 axis and then you transpose the result. If you transpose first, you move the axis of transposition, and then you invert around that.</p><p>Luckily there is a mathematical shortcut for inverting around zero and transposing. Look at the following correctly solved examples. Do you see a simple way to find the answers given only the numbers in the formula? It may be helpful to think of the original number series that we used at the top of the page, before we converted it using mod12. To make it easier to find the shortcut, the results have purposely <em>not</em> been put into normal form, although you should always do so after inverting.</p><p>T<sub>t</sub>I(2,6,7) = (8,4,3)</p><p>T<sub>5</sub>I(2,6,7) = (3,e,t)</p><p>T<sub>9</sub>I(2,6,7) = (7,3,2)</p><p>T<sub>0</sub>I(2,6,7) = (t,6,5)</p><h4 id="conclusion-9">Conclusion</h4><p>To quickly invert and transpose, just subtract each member of your pitch class from <code>n</code> in the formula <code>T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;I</code>.

Usually, the normal form of an inverted set the reverse order, but there are certain situations in which this will not be the case. You should always double-check your normal form to be sure.</p><p>Analyze and listen to the following short progressions.

For voice-leading purposes, the chord may sometimes have an enharmonically equivalent pitch–such as the <code>G#</code> shown in the third and sixth progressions–but we still always analyze this as a bII chord.</p><p>The above examples are three of the most common ways in which you should approach and leave a Neapolitan chord: - Directly to the V chord, most often the V<sup>7</sup> - Into a cadential 6/4 progression - Into a vii<sup>o7</sup>/V</p><p>As you observed in the example, the bII chord is most commonly used as a pre-dominant function. In this case, you can make the argument that it is most similar to a pre-dominant ii chord, because it has the same scale degrees of ^2, ^4, and ^6, with a lowered ^2 and ^6. While this is true, if you look at the common doubling and inversion of the Neapolitan chord–first inversion with a doubled third–it may be easier for you to consider the Neapolitan as a functional substitution for a borrowed iv chord. This ensures correct doubling and voice-leading tendencies. Look at the chords side-by-side in below, and you will notice there is only a half-step difference between the two chords.</p><p>{% capture ex3 %}X:3 T:bII6 and iv M:4/4 L:1/2 Q:1/4=90 K:C V:1 [F_A_d] [F_Ac]|] w:c:bII6 iv{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“3” abc=ex3 %}</p><p>Perhaps the most important reason for this doubling is that it solves two major part writing errors that occur for root-position bII chords: 1. <em>Resolving to V</em> - The root of the bII chord is a tendency tone and should not be doubled as we do for many chords. The flatted second scale degree pulls strongly downward, and when going directly to a V chord, it will resolve downward by an interval of a diminished 3rd to the third of the V chord. Of course, the chordal third of the V chord is also a tendency tone, so you would create multiple parallel perfect octaves if you were to double the root of the Neapolitan. 2. <em>Resolving to a cadential 6/4 or a vii<sup>o7</sup>/V</em> - Not only is the root a tendency tone, the chordal fifth of this chord (^b6) also wants to resolve downward. If the bII chord resolves to either a cadential 6/4 or a vii<sup>o7</sup>/V, the movement between the root and chordal fifth would create parallel perfect fifths. By using a first inversion triad and placing the chordal third in the bass, you are free to move the root above the chordal fifth in your voicing.</p><p>You may use a Neapolitan chord as a pre-dominant function in any progression in which you could use a minor iv chord. In minor, there is only one chromatic pitch (^b2), but in major, you will need to lower both ^2 and ^6.</p><h3 id="neapolitan-chords-as-dominant-chords">Neapolitan chords as dominant chords</h3><p>In the modal interchange video from Unit 17b, you may have noticed that one of the progressions used a bII chord. In the same unit, we then looked at a similar usage of the bII in the excerpt from Mahler Symphony No. 2. Let’s look at this again to refresh the details of your final analysis. How is the Neapolitan chord different from the above examples? What is its function here?

It shares many common tones with a vii<sup>o7</sup> chord, and these tendency tones follow the voice-leading resolutions that you would expect of a vii<sup>o7</sup>. When it is used to resolve to a I chord, the voice-leading issues are difficult to overcome, so you must be thoughtful in your approach and resolution.</p><p>Please note: While the Neapolitan is a commonly used chord, it is far more common to use it as a predominant function rather than as a functional substitution for dominant. Remember that if you ignore the standard tonic/dominant relationship too often, the listener will begin to lose the sense of diatonic progression. This can be good or bad depending on your desired outcome.</p><p>As always, if you study a chord’s voice-leading, you can use this to deduce its function.</p><p>Secondary chords can be extended beyond the dominant function, creating further tonicization of a chosen chord.</p><h3 id="extending-toniczation">Extending toniczation</h3><p>For the following chorale, provide leadsheet symbols and a Roman numeral analysis.

Instead focus on looking for “pockets” of tonality, in which you might be able to explain a progression easier through the lens of another key.</p><p>As with all analysis, you should never dwell too much on an individual chord in your first attempt.

If you look through your leadsheet symbols, you can clearly see a pattern that extends backwards if you continue thinking in the key of ii (D minor).

In the second progression, changing the C-sharp to a D-flat creates a d5 that implies an inward resolution of a V<sup>6/5</sup> to I in the key of A-flat major. Clearly, the pitch notation system we use is designed to show harmonic movement in a tonal setting.</p><h3 id="leaving-tonality">Leaving tonality</h3><p>As we move toward music that no longer relies on tonal harmony, the tools with which we notate analysis reflect the lack of a traditional tonal center. If a piece does not rely on the tonic and dominant relationship to provide tension and release, the importance of Roman numerals, scale degrees, and even pitch names becomes less useful. They are derived from a system that prioritizes seven pitches at a given time, so without that requirement, we need a method for demonstrating the relationships between all twelve chromatic pitches.</p><p>Look at the following ornamented melody. The numbers below the staff denote the <em>pitch class</em> for each pitch. (Note that <code>t</code> = 10, <code>e</code> = 11) Each number is considered a <em>pitch class</em> (abbrev.: pc), and the system itself is called <em>pitch-class (pc) integer notation</em>. After studying this example, what can you determine about the pitch classes? How do you determine which pitches are in a pitch-class? Is this numbering built around a key center or just a particular pitch?

This system is wonderful for showing intervals quickly, because each number is actually counting the number of half-steps away from zero. For fixed zero, D is two half steps away from zero, A is nine half steps away, and so on.

Notably, Joseph Straus created a wonderful teaching method for set theory in his <em>Introduction to Post-Tonal Theory</em>. Both are amazing references and if you need to explore the topic further, I recommend that you start with these after reading through the set theory overview of Unit 22.</p><p>When you perform a harmonic analysis, you are attempting to explain how a listener hears a harmonic progression and why it sounds either functional or non-functional to that person. To do so, we rely on our understanding of diatonic tendencies and voice-leading to explain likely listener interpretations, in the same way that a composer relies on their musical knowledge to elicit a desired reaction from a listener.</p><p>Once we go beyond looking at the fundamental aspects of music – rhythm, intervals, chords, keys, etc. – and begin combining these concepts to analyze function, we must begin to organize music into structures that combine rhythm, pitch, and timbre into complete musical ideas.</p><p>A <em>motive</em> is the smallest identifiable fragment of music. It can be a short melodic fragment, a short harmonic progression, a distinct rhythm, or a combination of these things. A composer can take a motive and build an entire work around it through various transformations, but it will always retain some fundamental relationships of pitch, rhythm, or both.</p><p>A <em>phrase</em> is the complete musical idea built to support a motive. The most common analogy used to describe a phrase is to compare it to a “musical sentence.” A good written or verbal sentence has a clear beginning, middle, and end. It has a few required structures and often some decorative parts to provide more specific function. This is exactly how a musical phrase works. It has a clear beginning, middle, and end; it has required structures to define its function; and it can be manipulated, decorated, and transformed to relate to the ideas that surround it. Phrases can sometimes be divided into <em>sub-phrases</em>, but these sub-phrases do not function independently; instead, sub-phrases are best thought of as motives with their supporting textures.</p><h3 id="identifying-phrases">Identifying phrases</h3><p>Now that you have a basic understanding of harmonic progressions, harmonic function, labeling function with Roman numerals, and cadences, you can combine these ideas to explore musical phrases. - After listening to Mozart’s <em>An Die Freude</em> multiple times (found below), mark the beginning and ending of each phrase based on your listening. - Remember that each phrase should sound like a complete musical idea with a clear beginning, middle, and end. - Once you have established these, label the last two chords of each phrase using Roman numerals and inversion figures. - Do each of your phrase endings fit one of the cadences discussed in Unit 7c? If so, label the cadence below the Roman numerals. - Identify at least one motive and describe what are defining characteristics of the motive. Rhythm? Specific intervals? Repeated progressions? - Find multiple iterations of your motive. How does Mozart transform it throughout the piece? - Once you have completed each of these steps, discuss what you think defines a phrase. What are the essential components?</p><p>Because this piece only has two voices, many chords will have more than one option for a harmony, so you must use the harmonic flowchart from the beginning of this chapter to choose the most likely harmony based on function. For example, if a harmony only has <code>mi</code> and <code>sol</code>, this could be either a I chord or a iii chord. If you put it into context, however, it will become clear what harmony the listener is likely to hear. If the harmony with <code>mi</code> and <code>sol</code> is preceded by <code>fa</code> and <code>sol</code>, it is highly unlikely that this is a iii chord. <code>fa</code> and <code>sol</code> outline a V<sup>7</sup> harmony, and a V chord will not resolve to a iii chord. Instead the listener will hear this as a V chord resolving to a I chord – albeit an unstable I chord.</p><p>Also note that this piece has multiple modulations that I have marked into the score. We will cover modulations in a later unit, but for now, make sure to analyze each phrase ending in the correct key. If you do not, your cadences will not make sense.</p><p>{% capture ex1 %}X:1 T:Mozart - An Die Freude M:2/4 L:1/8 Q:1/4=70 K:F V:1 F2- FG/2A/2| G4| AG/2A/2 BG| EF z2| F2- FA/2c/2| cB- BG/2F/2| E2- EG/2B/2| A2 z2| c2- cA/2F/2| d2 c2| cB BA| AG z2| G2- Gc| A2- Af/2d/2| c2- c=B| c2 z2| c2- ce/2c/2| Af ed| c2 =B2| c2 z2| A2- A_B/2c/2| cB AG| <em>e2 dc| B/2A/2G z2| c2- cd/2=e/2| fe dc| BA GF| c2 z2| c2- cd/2B/2| Af (3efd| c2- cd/2B/2| BA z2| c2- cA/2F/2| d2- dc/2B/2| Ac EG| F2 z2| c2- cB/2A/2| d/2f/2e/2g/2 fB| A2 G2| F2 z2|] V:2 clef=bass zA, G,F,| zE, D,C,| F,F, D,B,,| C,D, z2| zA, A,A,| zG, G,G,| w:F: C,C, C,C,| F,F, G,G,| A,A, A,A,| B,B,, A,,A,| G,E, F,=B,,| C,C, D,D,| E,E, E,E,| w:</em> _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ C: F,F, F,F,| G,G, G,G,| A,A, G,F,| E,E, E,E,| F,F, F,F,| G,G, G,,G,,| C,C/2D/2 C/2B,/2A,/2G,/2| ^F,F, F,F,| G,G, G,G,| ^F,F, F,F,| G,G, =F,F,| E,E, B,B,| A,C B,A,| w:g: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ F: B,A, G,F,| C,C, C,C,| E,E, E,E,| F,F, F,F,| E,E, E,E,| F,F, F,F,| A,A, A,A| B,B, B,B,| CC C,C,| D,D, D,D,| A,,A,, A,,A,,| B,,B, A,B,| CC C,C,| F,2 z2|]</p><p>{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“1” abc=ex1 %}</p><h3 id="conclusions-33">Conclusions</h3><p>A phrase is a complete musical idea that: - has a clear sense of harmonic progression. - ends with a cadence. - has a melodic structure that creates tension and release. - ends with longer rhythmic values to create a sense of slowing.</p><h4 id="phrase-key-to-an-die-freude">Phrase Key to <em>An Die Freude</em></h4><p>Phrases 1. m. 1-4 Deceptive cadence (DC) 2. m. 5-8 Imperfect Authentic Cadence (IAC) 3. m. 9-12 Half Cadence (HC) 4. m. 13-16 Deceptive Cadence (DC) 5. m. 17-20 Perfect Authentic Cadence (PAC) 6. m. 21-24 Imperfect Authentic Cadence (IAC) 7. m. 25-28 Half Cadence (HC) 8. m. 29-32 Imperfect Authentic Cadence (IAC) 9. m. 33-36 Deceptive Cadence (DC) 10. m. 37-40 Perfect Authentic Cadence (PAC)</p><p>In this piece, each phrase is four measures long, and most musical pieces will establish a “standard” phrase length.

Roman numeral analysis shows function–tonic, dominant, etc.,–but it shows this through each chord’s relationship to tonic. Simply put, you cannot write a Roman numeral if you do not know your tonic. On the other hand, leadsheet notation is limited in that it does not show how a chord functions, but it <em>does</em> provide a way to examine a chord quality independent of key or tonic. An F major chord could be a I chord in F major, a IV chord in C major, a III chord in D-flat major, and many others, but it will always be an F major chord.</p><p>Leadsheet notation does not rely on any pre-existing knowledge of the piece, and because of this, it is helpful to use this system as a shorthand when you begin analyzing a piece–particularly those with the potential for modulations. As you start analyzing an unfamiliar section of music it is helpful to write leadsheet symbols above the staff so that you can quickly reference them once you have completed a larger section of the music. This will allow you to look for patterns within chord progressions rather than having to repeatedly re-examine every chord each time that you discover something new.</p><h3 id="simple-modulations-and-common-chords">Simple modulations and common chords</h3><p>The simplest modulation is one that uses standard functional progressions and produces modulations through slight changes. Analyze the following excerpt from a Haydn piano sonata using leadsheet symbols. Even though there is only one altered note, it clearly ends in a different key than the key in which it starts. To begin understanding how this modulation works, ask these key questions: 1. Where do you first <em>hear</em> something changing? 2. How is the change prepared? 3. What harmonies transition into and out of the modulation?</p><p>Once you have answered these, create Roman numerals for <em>both the beginning key and the ending key</em>. (This will require secondary function chords.)

This chord can also act as the diatonic IV chord in the key of D major. Therefore, this moment is both the conclusion of V-I in G major as well as the beginning of a IV-V-I progression in D major. This is an exemplar of a <em>pivot chord</em>.</p><p>A pivot chord is a chord that allows the composer to smoothly modulate between two keys. Any chord can be used to pivot between two keys, but this chord must be part of a <strong>functional progression</strong> in <em>both</em> keys to be considered a pivot chord. If a chord does not have an obvious function on both sides of the pivot, it is not a pivot modulation. We will discuss the other modulatory techniques in the next topic.</p><h3 id="common-chords-between-keys">Common chords between keys</h3><p>The smoothest pivot chords will be diatonic to both keys, although we will study some common non-diatonic chords in Unit 16c. In the example above, if you pivot anywhere other than the G major chord that bridges the first and second phrases, you must use a secondary dominant. By having a chord that is diatonic to both keys, the transition between the two keys is as smooth as possible. The less strong the pivot chord’s function in both keys, the more jarring the modulation will be.</p><p>When a modulation centers around a common chord between two keys, we call this a <em>common chord pivot modulation</em>. To better understand why closely-related keys create smoother modulations, it is helpful to look at the number of common chords between the two keys. In the following chart, I have listed each chord from C major and G major, but I have aligned them by root rather than by scale degree.</p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>C major</th><th>Chord</th><th>Chord</th><th>G major</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>I</td><td><strong>C maj</strong></td><td><strong>C maj</strong></td><td>IV</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>ii</td><td>D min</td><td>D maj</td><td>V</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>iii</td><td><strong>E min</strong></td><td><strong>E min</strong></td><td>vi</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>IV</td><td>F maj</td><td>F#<sup>o</sup></td><td>vii<sup>o</sup></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>V</td><td><strong>G maj</strong></td><td><strong>G maj</strong></td><td>I</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>vi</td><td><strong>A min</strong></td><td><strong>A min</strong></td><td>ii</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>vii<sup>o</sup></td><td>B<sup>o</sup></td><td>B min</td><td>iii</td></tr></tbody></table><p>You can see that the two keys share four common chords (highlighted in bold), so writing a smooth progression in both keys is fairly easy because it can rely on multiple common chords.

To this point, we have focused on their role as dominant function chords in a second key. For example, we have shown repeatedly that a V<sup>7</sup>/V functions as the V chord <em>in the key of</em> V. This explains their voice-leading, but it does not address their <em>actual</em> function within the progression as a whole in the home key–the key of I. In the home key, the V<sup>7</sup>/V takes the place of a <em>pre-dominant</em> chord, most often replacing a ii chord.</p><p>This can be applied to vii<sup>o7</sup>/x as well. Notice that the roots of both dominant function chords–V and vii<sup>o</sup>–and the roots of pre-dominant chords–ii and IV–are separated by the interval of a third. If we add this observation to the idea that a V/V chord is a functional substitution for a ii chord, it reasons that a vii<sup>o</sup> chord is therefore a functional substitution for a IV chord.

This is often a chicken-or-the-egg question: you need to know how often the chord changes to determine which pitches to include in the chord, but you also need to look at which pitches create chords to figure out how often the chord changes. Chorales are an easy place to start, because most often, they change chords in a consistent rhythm–in this case, every beat–and this creates an easy-to-see visual cue as each chord is stacked vertically and mostly homorhythmic. For more complicated textures, studying melodic patterns and bass-lines is often enough to provide enough context for an educated guess. Bass-lines in particular will often sustain pitches and/or outline chords until the harmony changes, and this gives a clear indicator of probable harmonic rhythm.

In this textbook, we will primarily reference the widely-used English-language notation system that employs seven letter names and accidentals. This system is discussed below and is sufficient for differentiating between pitches in a diatonic tonality system. (If the terms <em>diatonic</em> and <em>tonality</em> don’t mean anything to you yet, don’t worry; we’ll cover those terms in later units.)</p><p>There are times, however, in which we want to discuss the <em>concept</em> of a tonal structure without tying ourselves to a particular tonal center, and we often see this concept in our every day lives. Take, for example, the common occurrence of a group of people spontaneously bursting into song–e.g. everyone singing <em>Happy Birthday</em> at a niece’s birthday party. These people do not likely have formal musical training and no one chooses a particular key, but the song is still completely recognizable. (Usually.)Instead, they start singing and their voice finds a comfortable key based on their vocal range. They do this by intuiting <em>the relative distance between pitches</em> rather than using a predetermined set of pitches. So to discuss how the distance between pitches implies tonal centers, we need a system that demonstrates <em>relative</em> distance without having to refer to the letter system.</p><p>There are multiple pre-existing systems that define music in relative terms, but for this textbook, we will use <em>moveable-“do” solfege</em>, a system that evolved from some of the earliest methods of notation. In this system, we assign the most privileged note of a scale to <code>do</code>, and then we assign each note above that pitch a similar Latin name based on its distance from <code>do</code>. For those of you familiar with the classic musical <em>The Sound of Music</em>, you probably already know the basic seven solfege. “Do, a deer, a female deer…and so on.</p><p>We will discuss this system in detail in the unit on scales, but until then, it will be helpful for you to refer to the following chart when necessary.</p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Scale degree</th><th>Solfege syllable</th><th>Raised</th><th>Lowered</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>^1</td><td>do</td><td>di</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>^2</td><td>re</td><td>ri</td><td>ra</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>^3</td><td>mi</td><td>N/A</td><td>me</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>^4</td><td>fa</td><td>fi</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>^5</td><td>sol</td><td>si</td><td>se</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>^6</td><td>la</td><td>li</td><td>le</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>^7</td><td>ti</td><td>N/A</td><td>te</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="accidentals-1">Accidentals</h4><p>This course assumes that you have a basic knowledge of how to raise and lower pitches in standard music notation.

At its core, enharmonic equivalence is an easy concept: When two pitches sound the same–meaning that they share identical <a href="https://amazing-space.stsci.edu/resources/explorations/groundup/lesson/glossary/term-full.php?t=wavelength_and_frequency">frequencies</a>–but have different note names (i.e. letters), we consider them to be enharmonically equivalent.</p><p>If you were to group all pitches that are enharmonic equivalents, you create a <em>pitch class</em>; such as C-sharp, D-flat, and B-double-sharp. There are twelve pitch classes in traditional Western tonality. Every pitch has multiple enharmonic equivalents, but some are used less frequently due to the necessity for uncommon accidentals such as double-sharps and double-flats.

Alto clef is typically thought of as a lower extension for treble clef; it adds the visual space of seven steps from treble clef. Tenor clef is a higher extension for bass clef and adds the visual space of five steps from bass clef. Of course, alto and tenor clef have similar ranges and one of the other could likely be eliminated with little issue – alto clef is visually seven steps from either treble or bass clef – but because both of these clefs have been widely used for more than a century, it is necessary for all musicians to be familiar with reading them.</p><h4 id="why-is-the-iso-system-based-on-c-instead-of-a">Why is the ISO system based on C instead of A?</h4><p>This is almost entirely related to the evolution of the musical notation system and how the non-accidental pitches (i.e. “white keys” of the keyboard) form a major scale.

Even though you are likely more familiar with major and minor scales to this point in your musical education, modes are commonly used in all types of Western music, including classical, jazz, pop, movie soundtracks, and folk music. As you listen to Happy Birthday played in each mode, take note of the basic structure of each mode by comparing how they are related to the major and minor scales. Is there an easy way to remember these?</p><p>Each mode can be “ranked” on a scale from the darkest to lightest sound, so on your first listen, take note of which sound dark and light to you. (Remember that describing a scale as light or dark is a somewhat subjective concept, so take your ranking with a grain of salt.) Once you have them grouped dark and light modes, see if you can figure out what each group has in common. Does there seem to be a pattern of notes that pushes a mode toward the extremes of your rankings?</p><p>Because we have yet to discuss tonality as a concept, you do not need to worry too much about the difference between modal and diatonic (i.e. major and minor) music yet.

Relating the modes to the major scale is a good way to memorize their construction, because many major scales are widely taught as the foundation of Western music. Eventually, you should strive to be able to recall each mode as its own entity, so that you can begin hearing the intracacies of how the mode functions musically, rather than hearing it as an derivative of the major scale.</p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Modes from C Ionian</th><th>^1</th><th>^2</th><th>^3</th><th>^4</th><th>^5</th><th>^6</th><th>^7</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Ionian</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>E</td><td>F</td><td>G</td><td>A</td><td>B</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Dorian</td><td>D</td><td>E</td><td>F</td><td>G</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Phyrgian</td><td>E</td><td>F</td><td>G</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>D</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Lydian</td><td>F</td><td>G</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>E</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Mixolydian</td><td>G</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>E</td><td>F</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Aeolian</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>E</td><td>F</td><td>G</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Locrian</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>E</td><td>F</td><td>G</td><td>A</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Lydian Dominant</td><td>F</td><td>G</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>Eb</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Of course, there are other ways to memorize these.

We often associate modes with early music, but as mentioned above, modal music is still common in many types of modern music. Using modes allows composers to create a range of colors, through a variety of techniques. For example, one popular theory ranks the modes from “light” to “dark” based on the number of raised or lowered pitches in the mode. If you apply this logic to the previous table, you can see that Lydian and Ionian would be the “brightest” modes because they have the most raised pitches, whereas Phrygian and Locrian would be the darkest modes because they have the most lowered pitches respectively.</p><p>Our “non-mode”–the Lydian Dominant scale–shares the altered pitches from both the Lydian and Mixolydian modes, so it cannot be derived in the same manner as the other modes. It is, however, useful in improvising over dominant seventh chords and has the unusual characteristic of acting as a hybrid of the whole tone and octatonic scales, two non-diatonic scales that we will discuss in Unit 22. After you read more about those two scales at a later date, return to the Lydian Dominant scale to see if you can determine <em>why</em> we consider it a hybrid of a whole tone and octatonic collections.</p><p>You should spend time exploring each of these modes to learn why one pitch can sound “tonicized” without a traditional dominant to tonic relationship. With very few exceptions, every piece of music contains a harmonic method for creating tension and release, and music written in these modes is no different. When listening to all of the versions of <em>Happy Birthday</em> above, you probably disliked the first time a mode landed on <code>te</code>, but after listening to multiple examples using <code>te</code>, it becomes normalized and can be heard as a weaker–but still functional–counterpart to <code>do</code>. Discovering how each mode creates tension and release is paramount to understanding modal usage, and will help you create a framework for any scale–including those below.</p><h3 id="basic-pentatonic-scales">Basic pentatonic scales</h3><p>We will discuss the pentatonic scales here because of their importance and prevalence in a variety of music, but these are not a complete modal shift from major and minor scales in the way that the modes are. Instead, certain the penatonic scales exclude certain pitches when compared to the parallel major or minor scale, which makes them easily related but functionally different.

An anticipation is a non-chord tone that will occur immediately before a change of harmony, and it will be followed on that change of harmony by the same note, now a chord tone of the new harmony. Therefore, it is approached by stepwise motion and left by static motion. The static motion between the NCT and its resolution means that you may consider this related to both suspensions and retardations, although unlike suspensions and retardations, this is an unaccented, off-chord NCT with static motion occurring <em>after</em> the NCT rather than before. It is typically found at the ends of phrases and larger formal units.</p><h5 id="syncopation-versus-anticipations">Syncopation versus anticipations</h5><p><img src="/images/embellishingTones/syncopatedNote.png" /></p><p>Some theorists classify syncopated rhythmic figures as separate from anticipations, but this is more a discussion of re-articulation. For those that classify these differently, <a href="http://openmusictheory.com/syncopation.html">syncopation</a> occurs when a rhythmic pattern that typically occurs on strong beats or strong parts of the beat occurs instead on weak beats or weak parts of the beat. Like the anticipation, the syncopated note is an early arrival — it tends to belong to the chord on the following beat. Unlike the anticipation, the syncopation is tied into a note in that chord and is not rearticulated. Rather than anticipating a note in the chord that follows, a syncopation is simply a disjointed and repeated arrival of the chord itself. Of course, you should consider context when making this decision as this difference is subtle, but if there is a pattern of syncopated rhythms in a passage, you could be more likely to label syncopation for the passage as a whole, rather than many anticpations.</p><h4 id="pedals-ped">Pedals (PED)</h4><p><strong>Pedals, often referred to as pedal points, most often occur in the bass voice but can occur in any voice.

Pedals are one of the most interesting non-chord tones because they have a dual nature–they create some of the strongest dissonances in tonal harmony, but their repetitive nature provides a sort of strange stability. As a pedal continues, it will often alternate between acting as a chord tone and non-chord tone, so it can be helpful to label the chord tones as “pedal figures” to show the continuation of the pedal.</p><h3 id="a-less-common-non-chord-tone">A less common non-chord tone</h3><h4 id="incomplete-neighbor-tone-int">Incomplete Neighbor Tone (INT)</h4><p>It is uncommon, but you will occasionally encounter an unaccented non-chord tone that is approached by leap and left in the <em>same</em> direction; resembling an appoggiatura but not resolving in the opposite direction.

First, we will establish a reference model by looking at the rules–and resulting errors from breaking those rules–that occur when writing in a four-part chorale style. We will then apply these guidelines to our own attempts to compose basic four-part chorales in order to better understand the voice-leading principles of diatonic music.</p><p>We will be referring to this handout, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s9Xd3LPqoaEevshTopxHzLX9jCzxVCZocOBLD_dceMU/edit?usp=sharing">Part-Writing Error Checklist and Guide</a>, for the next two units, so you may want to print this out or open it in a separate window.</p><h3 id="why-part-writing">Why part-writing?</h3><p>Before we begin, I would like to address a question that I have received many times from students. Why do we study part-writing rather than just analysis, particularly in a strict style that is not performed regularly by modern musicians?</p><p>There are many answers for this, but there is one in particular that I think justifies the study of this in this course. Part-writing is the simplest way to study <em>how</em> voice-leading creates harmony. Even though most of its rules are archaic, and a modern student’s ear is not nearly as offended by certain style characteristics (e.g. parallel perfect fifths), this is the most direct way to study every aspect of how music functions: voice-leading, chord progressions, voicing chords, chordal structure, tendency tones, melodic construction, and so on.</p><p>We could attempt to focus on only one style of modern music–whether pop, jazz, classical, or otherwise–but because each is a fully developed, complex language, you would still need to learn basic harmonic movement before beginning to write in that style. And because each of these musics has its roots in diatonic harmony, an understanding of basic chorale style part-writing will allow you to study and develop a process to analyze <em>all</em> of these styles, rather than focusing your studies into only one area and being ignorant of the others.</p><p>In short, focus on the <em>process</em> of the part-writing rather than trying to memorize every rule as if it is unbreakable. Even within a style, rules are guidelines, so an inflexible mindset will lead to nothing but frustration. Once you have grasped the basics of part-writing, you will have advanced another step toward the goal of improving your musicianship.</p><h3 id="traditional-errors">Traditional errors</h3><p>In the last <a href="10-intro-harmonic/a1-voiceleadingerrors.html">topic</a>, we first looked at some basic rules for voicing a chord in a four-part chorale style. These rules included: - Voice-crossing - In this style, voices generally should not cross - Exception: alto and tenor may cross briefly if musically necessary - Spacing - In this style, the top three voices–soprano, alto, and tenor–should always be within an octave of the adjacent voices. To be more specific, there can never be more than an octave between <em>soprano</em> and <em>alto</em>, and there can never be more than an octave bteween <em>alto</em> and <em>tenor</em>. - There <strong>can</strong> be more than an octave between <em>bass</em> and <em>tenor</em>. - There <strong>can</strong> be more than an octave between <em>soprano</em> and <em>tenor</em>, and this creates two different types of voicings. - A <em>closed voicing</em> has <strong>less</strong> than an octave between <em>soprano</em> and <em>tenor</em>. - An <em>open voicing</em> has <strong>more</strong> than an octave between <em>soprano</em> and <em>tenor</em>. - Range - Each part must stay within the typical range for that voice/instrument? - Doubling - You can double the root of a chord when possible. - For triads, you may double the fifth instead of the root if necessary. - This is actually more preferable if the triad is in second inversion. - <strong>Do not</strong> double the third because it is a tendency tone. If this is doubled, it will force you to choose between the incorrect resolution of a tendency tone or unacceptable parallel octaves. Also, the third should also be least present chord tone in the balance for the chord to sound best. - <strong>Do not</strong> double the seventh because it is a tendency tone. If this is doubled, it will force you to choose between the incorrect resolution of a tendency tone or unacceptable parallel octaves. - <strong>Do not</strong> double the fifth of a seventh chord. This would require omitting the root, third, or seventh, and none of these are expendable.</p><h3 id="part-writing-errors">Part-writing errors</h3><p>In addition to the voicing rules, there are a number of standard part-writing errors that should be avoided as well: 1. Parallel perfect octaves or perfect fifths 2. Similar octaves or fifths (sometimes referred to as “direct,” “hidden,” or “exposed”) 3. Unacceptable unequal fifths 4. Contrary perfect octaves or perfect fifths</p><p>Please note that these errors <em>must be within the same two voices</em> across both chords. Due to the effects of consistently doubling roots, there will almost always be consecutive perfect octaves and perfect fifths between two triads, but this is not <em>parallel</em>. For example, a root position C major triad moving to a root position G triad likely will have two voices on C in the first chord and two voices on G in the second chord, if standard doubling practices are observed. This is fine as long as its not in the <em>same</em> two voices in both chords (e.g. soprano and bass both have C and then both have a G).</p><p>Each of the four primary categories of part-writing errors are <em>symptoms</em> of voice-leading issues. If you understand the underlying voice-leading issues of each of these errors, you can find them more easily and avoid them in your own part-writing.</p><p><strong>Once you are comfortable with the descriptions of each of the errors below, try to fix each of the errors using the interface. What do you have to change? Do you have to alter the harmony? Voice-leading? Voicing? In trying to fix it, do you just create further errors?</strong></p><h3 id="parallel-perfect-fifths-and-perfect-octaves-pp5-pp8">Parallel perfect fifths and perfect octaves (PP5, PP8)</h3><p>Part-writing errors result from poor voice-leading. For example, look at the progression below and try to find our first major error: <em>parallel perfect octaves</em> (PP8). Once you have found it, look to see if a voicing rule (e.g. spacing, doubling, etc.) has been broken. If the voicing error is not fixed, is there any way to avoid the parallel octaves without incorrectly resolving a tendency tone?</p><p>{% capture ex1 %}X:1 T:Parallel perfect octaves (PP8) M:4/4 Q:1/4=80 L:1/2 K:C V:1 [cE] [AD]| [BF] [cE]|] V:2 clef=bass [C,G,] [F,A,] | [B,G,] [C,C]|] w:C:I ii6 V7 I{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“1” abc=ex1 %}</p><p>Listen to the following example, and try to locate the parallel perfect fifths aurally before you look through the parts.

Please note that for an interval to be considered <em>parallel</em>, the interval must occur consecutively in the <em>same</em> two voices. For example, if your first P8 is between the bass and alto, the second P8 must also be in the bass and alto. If you find a P8 between the bass and tenor on the second chord, this is acceptable because it does not undermine the independence of the voices.</p><h3 id="contrary-perfect-fifths-and-octaves-cp5-cp8">Contrary perfect fifths and octaves (CP5, CP8)</h3><p>Our next part-writing error, <em>contrary perfect fifths</em> and <em>contrary perfect octaves</em> (CP5 or CP8) are simply an attempt to cover up parallel perfect fifths and parallel perfect octaves by displacing one voice by an octave.

And because it is limited to certain voices, it is relatively easy to find compared to parallel and contrary fifths/octaves which are not acceptable between any voices.</p><p>For this course, we will consider a d5 moving to a P5 <em>unacceptable</em> unequal fifths, but we will consider a P5 moving to a d5 as <em>acceptable</em>–a P5 to a d5 does not require poor resolutions of tendency tones. Remember that these errors are best thought of as symptoms of the actual problem. In this case, the real issue is that the only two notes in a diatonic key that can form a d5 are <code>ti</code> and <code>fa</code>, and as discussed many times in this course, these two notes imply a dominant harmony that wants to resolve inward with <code>ti</code> moving to <code>do</code> and <code>fa</code> moving to <code>mi</code>. For a d5 to be followed by a P5, it would mean that <code>fa</code> must resolve to <code>sol</code>–or less commonly, <code>ti</code> resolving to <code>la</code> as part of a deceptive progression–which is poor voice-leading and therefore the error we are trying to avoid. There are some stricter versions of chorale part-writing that do not allow any form of unequal fifths.</p><h3 id="unacceptable-similar-fifths-or-octaves-us5-us8">Unacceptable similar fifths or octaves (US5, US8)</h3><p>The final common part-writing has many names, but we will use the term <em>unacceptable similar fifths or octaves</em>. The term <em>similar</em> can also be replaced with “direct,” “hidden,” or “exposed.” I prefer the term <em>similar</em> because it describes the motion like the other categories, but I also think that <em>exposed</em> does a fine job describing the effect. (I dislike the term <em>hidden</em> because students often confuse this with contrary fifths (or octaves), because the goal of contrary fifths is to “hide” parallel fifths.) <em>Unacceptable similar fifths or octaves</em> have the most restrictions. The conditions are: - They can only occur between the soprano and the bass voices. - They require a skip of a third or more in the soprano voice. - The two voices must move in similar (not parallel) motion. - The second interval must be a P5 or P8.</p><p>If any one of these conditions are <em>not</em> met, then this error does not exist in that case. Look at the following example to find an example of <em>similar octaves</em>. Once you have found it, look at the voice-leading around it. What does it do to spacing? Does it create more errors? Unacceptable similar octaves and fifths also often create melodies that imply different harmonies. To demonstrate, sing the melody alone.

Obviously, they must move in similar motion, but the term “exposed” highlights the fact that these must occur between the outer voices. By having similar motion to a perfect interval in the outer voices, it creates the impression of a parallel perfect interval. Most importantly, the leap in the soprano typically creates a poor soprano line in which the melody outlines/implies an unintentional harmony. In the example above, if you sing the melody line without the harmony it outlines A minor instead of C major.</p><p>When one begins reading transposed scores, it can be daunting to try to process the information, however, the best score readers are able to mentally “condense” the information into a score that contains all of the important parts to make sense of the most important information.

By combining these ideas with a general knowledge of diatonic chord progressions, we can begin composing our first attempts at chorale-style music.</p><p>Before beginning, please remember that when composing in this style, you occasionally will need to bend, or even break, these rules to accommodate other musical goals. There is not a “right” or “wrong” hierarchy for the conventional rules of part-writing. For example, you might choose to accept parallel perfect 5ths if you are trying to create a particular melodic line that emphasizes stepwise motion. Or, you might decide to use voice-crossing of the inner voices to change the timbre and texture of a passage. So even the cleverest of composers may choose to eschew convention if it does not align with their musical goals, but for our beginning attempts, you should do your best to observe every rule in order to understand their importance and implementation.</p><h3 id="reviewing-our-part-writing-process">Reviewing our part-writing process</h3><p>In <a href="11-further-part-writing/a1-funds-of-part-writing.html">Unit 11a</a>, we outlined a method for harmonizing a melody: 1. Identify the key 2. Determine your phrase 3. Choose a cadence to complete your phrase. 4. Create the rest of the diatonic progression beginning on tonic and ending with your cadence. 5. Compose a bass line based on your harmonization. 6. Fill in the alto and tenor voices.</p><p>And we employed the stylistic guidelines that we studied in Unit 10 to act as the framework for our part-writeing. - follow the standard harmonic progressions outlined by circle-of-fifths progressions - correctly use cadences - use functions such as tonic, dominant, and pre-dominant as general guides - employ the smoothest possible voice-leading for each line - The bass can be slightly more disjunct than the upper parts, particularly when using root-position chords. - do not cross voices - avoid spacing or range errors - avoid incorrect doubling - resolve tendency tones correctly - avoid unacceptable part-writing such as parallel perfect 5ths/8ves, contrary perfect 5ths/8ves, similar 5ths/8ves, and unequal 5ths</p><p>Remember that circle-of-fifths progressions work because the voice-leading taps into the primary functions of diatonic harmony. If you review <a href="07-harmonic-functions/a1-diaprogcirclefifths.html">Unit 7a</a>, you will remember that we created the harmonic flow chart by simply following good voice-leading between chords that have roots separated by a descending P5/ascending P4. Admittedly, long strings of root-position chords create unmelodic bass lines, but they still represent the strongest voicing for many sonorities.</p><h3 id="getting-started">Getting started</h3><p>To give you a chance to create all four voices, we will now compose a four-part chorale using a circle-of-fifths progression. Because you now have harmonies and a bass line composed for you, you can use the same process as above but replace steps 3 and 4 (and 5 if given a pre-determined bass line from the harmony): - <strong>Write a simple melody (soprano line)</strong> - Use mostly stepwise motion. - A good phrase will have an overall arc (upward or downward) with only one climax. - Leaps of a fourth or more should resolve by stepwise motion in the opposite direction.</p><p>Try to create a clean and simple texture.

The first chord is fully voiced to force you into certain decisions, so you will need to start from the beginning rather than working your way backward.</p><p>{% capture ex2 %}X:2 T:Root-position part-writing with T:seventh chords and root movement by P4/P5 M:4/4 L:1 K:C V:1 [cE]| x| x| x| x|] V:2 clef=bass [C,G,]| [A,,]|[D,]| [G,,]| [C,]|] w:C:I vi7 ii V7 I{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“2” abc=ex2 %}</p><h4 id="conclusion-19">Conclusion</h4><p>The addition of seventh chords create problems to solve as you now must contend with additional tendency tones. The first arises between the second and third chords. If you simply choose the smoothest voice-leading possible for each voice going into the second chord, vi<sup>7</sup>, you will place the chordal seventh in the tenor voice. This locks the voice-leading of the tenor voice into resolving downward by step to the third of the following ii chord, and in turn, that chordal third has its own tendencies and should resolve upward by step to the the root of the next chord. This means that the initial placement on the vi<sup>7</sup> effectively locks the entire tenor voice into place. From there, our alto voice is predetermined, because we do not want to double the third of the ii chord, leaving us with only the closest D or A. If we were to move to the A, that would create parallel perfect 5ths with the bass voice, so we can only choose the D for the alto voice. To move to the next chord, if we do not alter our soprano voice, we are then forced to place a B in the tenor voice which creates a less melodic tenor line.</p><p>{% capture ex10 %}X:10 T:Root-position part-writing with T:seventh chords and root movement by P4/P5 M:4/4 L:1 K:C V:1 [cE]| [cE]| [dD]| [dF]| [cE]|] V:2 clef=bass [C,G,]| [A,,G,]|[D,F,]| [G,,B,]| [C,C]|] w:C:I vi7 ii V7 I{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“10” abc=ex10 %}</p><p>While this works, it leaves many strange voicings, such as the tripled roots of the ii and I chords as well as the unmelodic tenor line.

For most, it will likely be when the progressions that have root-movement by 2nd, particularly a progression like IV-V-vi. Let’s examine this by isolating a common example of this movement, V moving to vi. In this progression, the V is acting according to its standard dominant function, but the vi chord has replaced the I chord in the position where a tonic chord usually appears. This progression represents a <em>functional substitution</em> in which vi is now acting as the tonic function. (This concept has application within the dominant and pre-dominant functions as well, but we need to explore first-inversion chords in the next topic, 11b, before we are ready for that discussion)</p><h4 id="function-over-form-part-1">Function over Form (Part 1)</h4><p>A <em>functional substitution</em> can, and often should, inform your voice-leading. When a root-position V chord precedes a root-position vi chord, we must choose to prioritize either our <em>doubling</em> conventions or our <em>part-writing</em> conventions. More specifically, do we want to double the third or do we want to end up with parallel perfect 8ves/5ths? We can demonstrate this by looking at two nearly identical progressions. Harmonize the following two progressions; first with the standard tonic function (i.e. V to I) and then with the functional substitution (i.e. V to vi.) Even though the I chord and vi chord have two common tones–the first and third scale degrees–you will have to make very different choices to avoid voice leading errors.</p><p>{% capture ex4 %}X:4 T:Using a functional substitution for a deceptive cadence M:3/4 L:1/4 Q:1/4=60 K:C V:1 [cE][B][c]| ] [cE][B][c]|] V:2 clef=bass [C,G,] [G,,] [C,]| [C,G,] [G,,] [A,,]|] w:C:I V I I V vi{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“4” abc=ex4 %}</p><p>When attempting this deceptive cadence, you hopefully realized that you cannot allow the tenor voice to remain on G and then resolve to A because it creates parallel octaves with the bass voice. Because the vi chord acts as a replacement for a I chord when it is part of a deceptive cadence, we double the scale degree that works best for a I chord, <code>do</code>, rather than the standard doubling of the root, <code>la</code> or fifth, <code>mi</code>. In this progression, it is correct to break standard convention for doubling and double the chordal third of the vi chord. This doubling should now be your permanent convention for deceptive cadences. - When V goes to vi, the vi chord is replacing the tonic function and therefore functions as a I<sup>sub6</sup></p><p>So for the above example, a better approach would be to alter the melody to allow for a doubling of the chordal third of the vi chord.</p><p>{% capture ex11 %}X:11 T:Using a functional substitution for a deceptive cadence M:3/4 L:1/4 Q:1/4=60 K:C V:1 [cE][dG][cE]|] V:2 clef=bass [C,G,] [G,,B,] [A,,C]|] w:C:I V vi{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“11” abc=ex11 %}</p><h4 id="root-movement-by-2nd">Root movement by 2nd</h4><p>The other difficult resolution in the previous example was when the root position IV chord moved to the V chord. We do not have a <em>functional substitution</em> to provide a doubling exception here, so instead you must be careful about how you resolve the voices.

So if you solely rely on smooth, stepwise voice-leading, you will likely create objectionable parallel movement between the two chords. For example, when composing he soprano line as you move from the IV to the V chord, you cannot choose <code>re</code>, because this creates parallel perfect 5ths against the bass. So you must choose to move to the leading tone instead which locks your soprano line into <code>C - C - B - C</code>. From there, you will have to use some small skips in your other voices to resolve every voice in the smoothest possible way. There are a few different options for this progression, but you likely ended up with something like this.</p><p>{% capture ex12 %}X:12 T:Completed root movement by 2nd M:4/4 L:1/4 Q:1/4=60 K:C V:1 [cE] <a href="cantusFirmus.html">cF</a> [BD] [cE]|] V:2 clef=bass [C,G,] [F,,A,] [G,,G,] [C,G,]|] w:C:I IV V I{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“12” abc=ex12 %}</p><h3 id="common-exceptions">Common exceptions</h3><p>There are some commonly used exceptions to our general part-writing conventions. For example, when a chord progression has a root that moves down by P5, we expect the chordal third to resolve up by step to the root of the following chord. However, if you need to change the texture of your part-writing to be more or less compact, you may choose to have the chordal third leap to the following chordal third which changes the entire voicing possibilities of the two chords. (Note that you can only use this on the leading tone if it is in an inner voice.) Use this method to fill in the inner voices in the following example to change the voicing of the final chord.</p><p>{% capture ex6 %}X:6 T:Chordal third to chordal third M:4/4 L:1/4 Q:1/4=60 K:C V:1 [eG] [d] [c2]|] V:2 clef=bass [C,C] [G,,] [C,2]|] w:C:I V I{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“6” abc=ex6 %}</p><p>Another common exception is called the <em>frustrated leading tone</em>.

Luckily, if you develop an order to process the guidelines, they greatly simplify the part-writing process. It is much simpler to write a melody when you only have one or two options for the next pitch!</p><p>As stated above, you should use smooth voice-leading when possible, making it a high priority in your decision-making process. But what constitutes “smooth” voice-leading? The simple answer is that stepwise, or sometimes static, motion is preferred, although this is only one decision point to consider. When you are creating a line, you will need to balance stepwise motion against avoiding errors. For our simple chorale-style, we are not using non-chord tones yet, so your next pitch must be a chord-tone. This means that you must also consider the notes that are already present such as the bass line or melody in order to ensure that you form a complete harmony and avoid errors. When you add in doubling and range limitations, you can usually narrow your options to one pitch.</p><p>You should also understand that while there are some general guidelines for resolving tendency tones, there are no simple rules that are unbreakable. At its most basic, <code>ti</code> resolves up by step, and <code>fa</code> resolves down by step. When part-writing, however, this is too simplistic a view. For example, <code>fa</code> often moves upward by step to <code>sol</code>, either as part of an ascending scalar melodic line or in the bass line when a pre-dominant chord (i.e. IV or ii<sup>6</sup> moves to a root-position V chord. A more advanced part-writer may think that <code>ti</code> and <code>fa</code> are tendency tones when they are part of a V<sup>7</sup> chord, so therefore, the rule for tendency tones should be that <em>chordal thirds</em> resolve up by step and <em>chordal sevenths</em> resolve down by step. This is a better rule, but it also falls apart when we leave circle-of-fifths progressions (chords with roots separated by a descending P5). When a IV chord moves to a V chord, it is impossible for the third to move <em>up by step</em> to the root of the V chord. For now, the easiest rule for tendency tones is: - <em>Chordal thirds</em> resolve up by step and <em>chordal sevenths</em> resolve down by step <em>when part of a circle-of-fifths progression</em>.</p><h4 id="our-part-writing-process">Our part-writing process</h4><p>As a review, here are our finalized methods for part-writing in a four-part chorale style:</p><h4 id="if-given-a-melody">If given a melody:</h4><ul><li><strong>Identify the key</strong><ul><li>Look for melodic patterns, starting pitches, and ending pitches for clues as to an implied key.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Determine your phrase</strong><ul><li>In a short excerpt such as many of your assignments, you will have little room for decision making, but for a larger melody, try singing the phrase repeatedly and listen to your natural inclination for breaths or pauses.</li><li>It can also be helpful to look for spots in which the rhythm slows naturally.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Choose a cadence</strong> to complete your phrase.<ul><li>Refer to <a href="07-harmonic-functions/c1-cadences.html">Unit 7c</a> to review the types of cadences.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Create the rest of the diatonic progression</strong> beginning on tonic and ending with your cadence.

(These model <em>cantus firmi</em> can also be used as the starting points for our two-voice exercises.)</p><p>From these <em>cantus</em>, notice how the general musical characteristics of smoothness, melodic integrity, variety, and motion towards a goal are worked out in specific characteristics. The following characteristics are typical of all well formed <em>cantus firmi</em>:</p><ul><li>length of about 8–16 notes<br />
</li><li>arhythmic (all whole notes; no long or short notes)<br />
</li><li>begin and end on <em>do</em><br />
</li><li>approach final tonic by step (usually <em>re</em>–<em>do</em>, sometimes <em>ti</em>–<em>do</em>)<br />
</li><li>all note-to-note progressions are <a href="intervals.html">melodic consonances</a><br />

</li><li>no more than two leaps in a row; no consecutive leaps in the same direction (Fux’s F-major <em>cantus</em> is an exception, where the back-to-back descending leaps outline a consonant triad.)<br />
</li><li>the leading tone progresses to the tonic<br />
</li><li>in minor, the leading tone only appears in the penultimate bar; the raised submediant is only used when progressing to that leading tone</li></ul><h5 id="melodic-tendencies">Melodic tendencies</h5><p>The characteristics listed above are fairly detailed, and some of them are specific to strict species counterpoint. However, taken together, they express in detail some general tendencies of melodies in a variety of styles.</p><p><a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL5851060W/Sweet_Anticipation">David Huron</a> identifies five general properties of melodies in Western music that connect to the basic principles of perception and cognition listed above, but play out in slightly different specific ways in musical styles. They are:</p><ul><li><strong>pitch proximity</strong> – the tendency for melodies to progress by steps more than leaps and by small leaps more than large leaps. An expression of smoothness and melodic integrity.<br />
</li><li><strong>step declination</strong> – the tendency for melodies to move by <em>descending</em> step more than ascending. Possibly an expression of goal-oriented motion, as we tend to perceive a move down as a decrease in energy (movement towards a state of rest).<br />
</li><li><strong>step inertia</strong> – the tendency for melodies to change direction less frequently than they continue in the same direction. (I.e., the majority of melodic progressions are in the same direction as the previous one.) An expression of smoothness and, at times, goal-oriented motion.<br />
</li><li><strong>melodic regression</strong> – the tendency for melodic notes in extreme registers to progress back towards the middle. An expression of motion towards a position of rest (with non-extreme notes representing “rest”). Also an expression simply of the statistical distribution of notes in a melody: the higher a note is, the more notes there are below it for a composer to choose from, and the less notes there are above it.<br />
</li><li><strong>melodic arch</strong> – the tendency for melodies to ascend in the first half of a phrase, reach a climax, and descend in the second half. An expression of goal-orientation and the rest–motion–rest pattern. Also, a combination of the above rules in the context of a musical phrase.</li></ul><h4 id="first-species-counterpoint">First species counterpoint</h4><p>Counterpoint is the mediation of two or more musical <em>lines</em> into a meaningful and pleasing <em>whole</em>. In first-species counterpoint, we not only write a smooth melody that has its own integrity of shape, variety, and goal-directed motion, but we also write a second melody that contains these traits. Further, and most importantly, we combine these melodies to create a whole texture that is smooth, exhibits variety and goal-oriented motion, and in which these melodies both maintain their independence and fuse together into consonant <em>simultaneities</em> (the general term for two or more notes sounding at the same time).</p><h5 id="the-counterpoint-line">The counterpoint line</h5><p>In general, the counterpoint should follow the principles of <a href="cantusFirmus.html">writing a good cantus firmus</a>. There are some minor differences, to be discussed below, but generally a first-species counterpoint should consist of two cantus-firmus-quality lines.</p><h5 id="beginning-a-first-species-counterpoint">Beginning a first-species counterpoint</h5><p>To exemplify goal-oriented motion, the first-species exercise should begin and end with the most stable of sonorities: perfect consonances. Thus, when writing a counterpoint <em>above</em> a cantus firmus, the first note of the counterpoint should be <em>do</em> or <em>sol</em> (a P1, P5, or P8 above the cantus).</p><p>When writing a counterpoint <em>below</em> a cantus firmus, the first note of the counterpoint must always be <em>do</em> (P1 or P8 below the cantus). (Beginning on <em>sol</em> would create a dissonant fourth; beginning on <em>fa</em> would create a P5 but confuse listeners about the tonal context, since <em>fa–do</em> at the beginning of a piece is easily misheard as <em>do–sol</em>.)</p><h5 id="ending-a-first-species-counterpoint">Ending a first-species counterpoint</h5><p>The final note of the counterpoint must always be <em>do</em> (P1 or P8 above/below the cantus).</p><p>To approach this ending smoothly, with variety, and with strong goal orientation, always approach the final interval by contrary stepwise motion. If the cantus ends <em>re</em>–<em>do</em>, the counterpoint’s final two pitches should be <em>ti</em>–<em>do</em>. If the cantus ends <em>ti</em>–<em>do</em>, the counterpoint’s final two pitches should be <em>re</em>–<em>do</em>. Thus the penultimate bar will either be a minor third or a major sixth between the two lines. This is the case for both major and minor keys.</p><h5 id="independence-of-the-lines">Independence of the lines</h5><p>Like the cantus firmus, the counterpoint should have a single climax. To maintain the independence of the lines and the smoothness of the entire passage (so no one moment is hyper-emphasized by a double climax), these climaxes should not coincide.</p><p>A single repeat/tie in the counterpoint is allowed, but try to avoid repeating at all. This promotes variety in the exercise, since there are so few notes to begin with.</p><p>Avoid <em>voice crossing</em>, where the upper voice is temporarily lower than the lower voice, and <em>vice versa</em>. Voice crossings diminish the independence of the lines and make them more difficult to distinguish by ear.</p><p>Avoid <em>voice overlap</em>, where one voice leaps past the previous note of the other voice. For example, if the upper part sings an E4, the lower part cannot sing an F4 in the following bar. This also helps maintain the independence of the lines.</p><h5 id="intervals-and-motion">Intervals and motion</h5><p>The interval between the cantus and counterpoint at any moment should not exceed a perfect twelfth (octave plus fifth). In general, try to keep the two lines within an octave where possible, and only exceed a tenth in “emergencies,” and only briefly (one or two notes). When the voices are too far apart, tonal fusion is diminished. Further, it can diminish <em>performability</em>, which though not an essential principle of human cognition is an important consideration for composers, and it has a direct effect on the smoothness, melodic integrity, and tonal fusion of what listeners hear during a performance.</p><p>In general, all harmonic <em>consonances</em> are allowed. However, unisons should only be used for first and last intervals. Unisons are very stable, and serve best as goals rather than mid points. They also diminish the independence of the lines.</p><p><em>Imperfect consonances</em> are preferable to <em>perfect consonances</em> for all intervals other than the first and last dyads, in order to heighten the sense of arrival at the end, and to promote a sense of motion towards that arrival. In all cases, aim for a variety of harmonic intervals over the course of the exercise.</p><p><em>Never, ever, ever</em> use two perfect consonances of the same size in a row: <strong>P5–P5</strong> or <strong>P8–P8</strong>. This includes both simple and compound intervals. For example, <strong>P5–P12</strong> is considered the same as <strong>P5–P5</strong>. (Two different perfect consonances in a row, such as <strong>P8–P5</strong>, is allowed, however, but try to follow every perfect consonance with an imperfect consonance if possible.) These “parallel fifths and octaves” significantly promote tonal fusion over melodic independence at the same time that the consecutive stable sonorities arrest both the variety and the motion of the exercise. Thus, they are far from ideal, and to be avoided in species counterpoint.</p><p>Vary the types of motion between successive intervals (parallel, similar, contrary, oblique). Try to use all types of motion (except, perhaps, oblique motion), but prefer contrary motion where possible. It is best for preserving the independence of the lines, in addition to variety.</p><p>Because similar and parallel motion diminish variety and melodic independence, their use should be mediated by other factors:</p><ul><li>Do not use more than three of the same imperfect consonance type in a row (e.g., three thirds in a row).<br />
</li><li><em>Never</em> move into a perfect consonance by similar motion (this is called <em>direct</em> or <em>hidden octaves</em>). This draws too much attention to an interval which already stands out of the texture.<br />
</li><li>Avoid combining similar motion with leaps, especially large ones.</li></ul><h4 id="demonstration">Demonstration</h4><p>In the following video, I illustrate the process of composing a first-species counterpoint.

Since all three upper voices must be played by a single hand, they should never span more than an octave.</p><p>The melody always has an upward-pointing stem. Alto and tenor share a downward-pointing stem. If the alto and tenor share a note, that note receives a single downward-pointing stem. (See m. 1 of the example below.) If melody and alto share a note, that notehead is double-stemmed. (See m. 4 of the example below.)</p><p><a href="images/BCModel.png"><img src="images/BCModel.png" /></a></p><p>When choosing the notes to place in the upper voices above a figured bass, use the bass and figures to determine the pitch classes present in the chord. (When realizing an <em>unfigured bass</em>, you must determine appropriate figures before realizing.) If the chord is a four-note chord, use each chord member once, including the bass (exceptions will be noted later). If a chord has three pitch-classes (a triad, for instance), use each pitch-class once, and “double” one of them according to the following principles:</p><ul><li>If the figure is 6/4, 5/3, or other chord of the fifth, double the bass pitch class.<br />
</li><li>If the figure is 6/3 and the bass is a <em>fixed scale degree</em> (<em>do</em>, <em>re</em>, <em>fa</em>, or <em>sol</em>), double the bass pitch class.<br />
</li><li>If the figure is 6/3 and the bass is a <em>variable scale degree</em> (<em>mi</em>/<em>me</em>, <em>la</em>/<em>le</em>, or <em>ti</em>/<em>te</em>) or a chromatically altered pitch, double one of the upper voices at the octave or unison.<br />
</li><li>Generally, do not double a variable scale degree or a chromatically altered pitch.</li></ul><h4 id="tendency-tones-1">Tendency tones</h4><p>A <em>tendency tone</em> is a pitch (class)—usually represented as a scale degree—that tends to progress to some pitch classes more than others. Sometimes this tendency is absolute within a style, but more often it is context-dependent.</p><p>The most prominent tendency tones in Western tonal styles are <em>ti</em> (not <em>te</em>) and <em>le</em> (not <em>la</em>).</p><p>Generally speaking, when <em>ti</em> appears it tends to be followed by <em>do</em> in the same voice. In a harmonic context, this tendency is strongest when <em>ti</em> occurs in a dominant-functioning chord, and the “resolution” of that tendency comes upon change of function (to tonic or predominant).</p><p>Likewise, when <em>le</em> appears, it tends to be followed by <em>sol</em> in the same voice. This tendency is less dependent on function.</p><p>Exceptions to these tendencies include:</p><ul><li>When <em>ti</em> is in the middle of a stepwise descent (<em>re</em>–<em>do</em>–<em>ti</em>–<em>la</em>–<em>sol</em>, for example), it can progress down by step. (Note that <em>step inertia</em> here diminishes the effect of an “unresolved” tendency tone. Because there are two conflicting tendencies in play, in this case, either can be “resolved” unproblematically.)<br />
</li><li>When <em>ti</em> is in an inner voice, it can progress down to <em>sol</em> if necessary to accomplish good voice-leading in the other voices and ensure complete chords. This is called a <em>frustrated leading-tone</em>.<br />
</li><li>When <em>ti</em> is a functional dissonance of a tonic-functioning chord (see below) it should progress down by step.</li></ul><h4 id="functional-dissonances-1">Functional dissonances</h4><p>Some tendencies, such as the tendency for <em>le</em> to progress down, are relatively context-independent. Others are heavily contextualized. The primary contextual tendency for how melodic notes progress is the concept of <em>functional dissonance</em>.</p><p>Keep in mind from the <a href="harmonicFunctions.html">Harmonic functions resource</a> that chords tend to cluster in one of three functional groups (<strong>T</strong>, <strong>P</strong>, or <strong>D</strong>) When pitches fuse into a chord expressing one of these three functions, the pitches that comprise that have certain tendencies of progression that they may or may not have in other contexts.</p><p>Following are the scale degrees which act as dissonances for their respective functions:</p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th style="text-align: right;">function</th><th style="text-align: center;">dissonances</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: right;">T or Tx</td><td style="text-align: center;">7, 5 when 6 is also present</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: right;">P</td><td style="text-align: center;">3, 1 when 2 is also present</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: right;">D</td><td style="text-align: center;">4, 6</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In purely diatonic music (triads and seventh chords, no chromatics), these will include <em>the seventh of every seventh chord</em>, <em>the fifth of viiº or VII</em> (<em>fa</em>), and <em>the fifth of III or iii</em> (<em>ti/te</em>).</p><p>Keep in mind that only sometimes do these functional dissonances express themselves in chords or intervals that are acoustically dissonant. However, they do introduce a degree of tension that, like an acoustically dissonant interval in species counterpoint, requires a smooth introduction and a specific resolution.</p><p>When one of these scale degrees is present in a chord with the corresponding function, the dissonant scale degree has a strong tendency to <em>resolve down by step over the next change in function</em>. In strict composition, we will <em>always</em> follow these tendencies.</p><p>In strict keyboard style, these functional dissonances should be “prepared” (approached) by common tone or by step. Thus, though they are proper members of the chord, melodically they will look like one of the three dissonance types of species counterpoint: a <em>passing tone</em> or <em>neighbor tone</em> dissonance that is approached by step, or a <em>suspension</em> dissonance that is approached by a common tone. The suspension type is preferred.</p><p>Once a functional dissonance is introduced, it must be resolved down by step in the same voice when the function changes. The dissonance can also be <em>transferred</em> to another voice before resolution—for instance, if there are multiple chords in a row exhibiting the same function, a dissonance that appears in the alto can be transferred to the tenor in the following chord, and then resolve in the tenor when the function changes. (It is more typical, and smoother sounding, to transfer dissonances between inner voices or from an inner voice to an outer voice than from an outer voice to an inner voice. Once a dissonance appears in the melody or bass, where it is more noticeable, it tends to resolve in that voice.)</p><p>Functional dissonance resolutions often cause conflicts with other principles of voice leading. Except in special cases such as <em>schemata</em> (standard patterns that are common enough to sound appropriate, even if they follow different rules), the functional dissonance resolution takes precedence over other principles such as the <em>law of the shortest way</em>, contrary motion with the bass, and preferring common tones and steps to melodic leaps. A dissonance resolution is never an excuse for illegal parallels, and only rarely will lead to non-standard doublings.</p><h2 id="class-discussion-32">Class Discussion</h2><p>Process of harmonic analysis - What you should try and do as early as possible is determine the <em>harmonic rhythm</em>, or how often the chord changes. This can happen every beat, every measure, or many other ways. The chorale we looked at in class is an example where the harmonic rhythm is every beat. - Key: try not to rely as much on the key signature to figure out what key you’re in. Think of it as just one of many tools. There are other indicators of key–what chord does the section start on? What accidentals are repeatedly occurring in the section? Do these fit in with a major key or a minor one? - Leadsheet: doing this first will save time in writing out your Roman numerals, especially if you are still unsure of what key you’re in. - <em>You do not need to repeat the Roman numerals for multiples of the same chord in a row.</em></p><h2 id="further-reading-19">Further Reading</h2><h3 id="the-three-common-practice-harmonic-functions">The three common-practice harmonic functions</h3><p>In common-practice music, harmonies tend to cluster around three high-level categories of harmonic function. These categories are traditionally called <em>tonic</em> (<strong>T</strong>), <em>pre-dominant</em> (<strong>P</strong> — sometimes referred to as <em>subdominant</em>, <strong>S</strong>), and <em>dominant</em> (<strong>D</strong>). Each of these functions has their own characteristic scale degrees, with their own characteristic tendencies. And each of these functions tend to participate in certain kinds of chord progressions more than others.</p><p>If you are already comfortable with Roman numerals, you can generally think of <strong>I</strong>, <strong>III</strong>, and <strong>VI</strong> as <em>tonic</em>, <strong>II</strong> and <strong>IV</strong> as <em>pre-dominant</em>, and <strong>V</strong> and <strong>VII</strong> as <em>dominant</em>. (Though, as you will see below, there is more to it than that.)</p><p>To visualize these functional categories, think of the usual triads in C major arranged on a circle of thirds. Note that each chord sits between the two triads that share the most tones in common — C major (C, E, G) sits between E minor (E, G, B) and A minor (A, C, E), both of which share two tones in common with C.</p><p><a href="images/harmony/circleOfThirds-leadSheet.png"><img src="images/harmony/circleOfThirds-leadSheet.png" style="max-width: 400px; border: 1px;" alt="Diatonic chords of C major positioned on the circle of thirds."></a></p><p>Convert these chords to Roman numerals (in C major), and we can see the functions. Since the function is determined by the tendencies of the tones that they share, and since on this graph chords are grouped together by notes they have in common, they are also grouped together by function.</p><p><a href="images/harmony/circleOfThirds-functions.png"><img src="images/harmony/circleOfThirds-functions.png" style="max-width: 400px; border: 1px;" alt="Diatonic chords of any major key represented by Roman numerals positioned on the circle of thirds with harmonic functions labeled."></a></p><p><em>Triads arranged on the circle of thirds, labeled by harmonic functions.</em></p><p>Interestingly, in common-practice music, a chord’s function can be determined solely by its internal characteristics (the notes that make up the chord). This is not true of all styles. For example, in pop/rock music a <strong>IV</strong> chord can exhibit very different functional tendencies depending on its context. But in classical music, simply knowing the notes in a chord is enough to determine its general harmonic function and the general tendencies of that chord and its individual notes.</p><p>The syntactic properties of these functions will be covered elsewhere. What follows simply explains how to determine the function of a chord in common-practice music with greater specificity.</p><h3 id="finding-the-function-of-a-chord">Finding the function of a chord</h3><p>Each of the three harmonic functions — <em>tonic</em> (T), <em>pre-dominant</em> (P), and <em>dominant</em> (D) — have characteristic scale degrees. Tonic’s characteristic scale degrees are 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7. Pre-dominant’s characteristic scale degrees are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Dominant’s characteristic scale degrees are 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7.</p><p>Ian Quinn (a music theorist at Yale University) further distinguishes these scale degrees, using the categories of functional <em>triggers</em>, functional <em>associates</em>, and functional <em>dissonances</em>. These categories help us understand the functional properties of chords whose scale degrees belong to more than one function, as well as how certain notes behave within a chord. They also help us understand which scale degrees are more or less characteristic of a function ― something that will help determine function when a complete chord is not present.</p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th style="text-align: center;">function</th><th style="text-align: left;">triggers</th><th style="text-align: left;">associates</th><th style="text-align: left;">dissonances</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;"><strong>T</strong></td><td style="text-align: left;">1 and 3</td><td style="text-align: left;">5 and 6</td><td style="text-align: left;">5 (if 6 is also present) and 7</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: center;"><strong>P</strong></td><td style="text-align: left;">4 and 6</td><td style="text-align: left;">1 and 2</td><td style="text-align: left;">1 (if 2 is also present) and 3</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;"><strong>D</strong></td><td style="text-align: left;">5 and 7</td><td style="text-align: left;">2</td><td style="text-align: left;">4 and 6</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In terms of moveable-<em>do</em> solfège:</p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th style="text-align: center;">function</th><th style="text-align: left;">triggers</th><th style="text-align: left;">associates</th><th style="text-align: left;">dissonances</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;"><strong>T</strong></td><td style="text-align: left;"><em>do</em> and <em>mi</em>/<em>me</em></td><td style="text-align: left;"><em>sol</em> and <em>la</em>/<em>le</em></td><td style="text-align: left;"><em>sol</em> (if <em>la</em>/<em>le</em> is also present) and <em>ti</em>/<em>te</em></td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: center;"><strong>P</strong></td><td style="text-align: left;"><em>fa</em> and <em>la</em>/<em>le</em></td><td style="text-align: left;"><em>do</em> and <em>re</em></td><td style="text-align: left;"><em>do</em> (if <em>re</em> is also present) and <em>mi</em>/<em>me</em></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;"><strong>D</strong></td><td style="text-align: left;"><em>sol</em> and <em>ti</em>/<em>te</em></td><td style="text-align: left;"><em>re</em></td><td style="text-align: left;"><em>fa</em> and <em>la</em>/<em>le</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>To determine the function of a chord, find the function that includes all the scale degrees of a chord (regardless of chromatic alterations ― that is, treat ♯4 the same as regular scale-degree 4). If more than one function contains all the scale degrees, take the function with the most triggers in the chord.</p><p>There is one exception to this (for now): a chord with scale degrees 6, 1, and 3 is a special kind of tonic chord, called a <em>destabilized tonic</em>. Quinn uses the special functional label is <strong>Tx</strong>, rather than simply <strong>T</strong>, for this chord.</p><p>Also note that because the III<sup>7</sup> chord’s scale-degrees do not wholly belong to any of the three functions, it can behave similar to <strong>T</strong> and <strong>D</strong> chords, depending on context. It is a rare chord in its diatonic form.</p><p><a href="/images/Handouts/HarmoniesByBassScaleDegree.pdf">This handout</a> will help you determine the function of a chord from the bass scale degree and/or the Roman numeral.</p><h3 id="class-discussion-33">Class Discussion</h3><p>TBD</p><h3 id="further-reading-20">Further Reading</h3><h4 id="from-open-music-theory-19">From <em>Open Music Theory</em></h4><h4 id="the-keyboard">The Keyboard</h4><p>The keyboard is great for helping you develop a visual, aural, and tactile understanding of music theory. On the illustration below, the <em>pitch-class</em> letter names are written on the keyboard.</p><p><img src="images/keyboardlayout-small.png" /></p><h4 id="enharmonic-equivalence">Enharmonic equivalence</h4><p>Notice that some of the keys have two names. When two pitch classes share a key on the keyboard, they are said to have <em>enharmonic equivalence</em>. Theoretically, each key could have several names (the note C could also be considered D♭♭, for instance), but it’s usually not necessary to know more than two enharmonic spellings.</p><h4 id="octave-designation">Octave Designation</h4><p>When specifying a particular pitch precisely, we also need to know the <em>register</em>. In fact, if all you have is C-sharp or B-flat, you do not have a <em>pitch</em>, you have a <em>pitch-class</em>. A pitch-class plus a register together designate a specific pitch.</p><p>We will follow the International Standards Organization (ISO) system for register designations. In that system, middle C (the first ledger line above the bass staff or the first ledger line below the treble staff) is C4. An octave higher than middle C is C5, and an octave lower than middle C is C3.</p><p>Here is the pitch C4 placed on the treble, bass, alto, and tenor clefs.</p><p><img src="images/clefs.png" width="50%" height="50%"></p><p>The tricky bit about this system is that the octave starts on C and ends on B. So an ascending scale from middle C contains the following pitch designations:</p><p><img src="images/C4toC5.png" /></p><p>And a descending scale from middle C contains the following pitch designations:</p><p><img src="images/C4toC3.png" /></p><p>Pitches on the alto staff are as follows:</p><p><img src="images/F3toG4-alto.png" /></p><p>Pitches on the tenor staff are as follows:</p><p><a href="images/pitchesTenor.png"><img src="images/pitchesTenor.png" width="70%"></a></p><p>Any accidentals follow the octave designation of the natural pitch with the same generic name. Thus a half step below C4 is C-flat4 (even though it sounds the same as B3), and a half step above C4 is C-sharp4.</p><p>Note that a complete designation contains both the pitch-class name (a letter name plus an optional sharp or flat) and the register (the ISO number indicating the octave in which the pitch is found). Unless both are present, you do not have the full designation of a specific pitch.</p><h2 id="class-discussion-34">Class discussion</h2><p><strong>Double Neighbor Tones</strong> Decorates a single pitch, has to come back to the original pitch. - Enclosure!

This results in resolutions to different keys from enharmonically equivalent chords.</p><p><strong>Happy Birthday in G Major (a la R. Strauss)</strong> - Welcome to pitch class integer notation!! - Remember we only use 0-e in this form of notation. 0 is also 12 (and 1 is also 13, 2 is also 14, etc…) - In this system, there is no difference between C# and Db. Both are written as 1. While it’s important to distinguish these notes in tonality, we’re post-tonal! The notes don’t matter. - All enharmonic equivalents are called a pitch class. This also includes double sharps and double flats. For example, C#, Db#, and Bx are all in the same pitch, class, represented as 1. - What reasons are there to use this system? - Quickly identifying pitches (or pitch classes) - Identifying non-diatonic scales? - Is C always 0? - In fixed zero notation, yes! There is also movable zero notation. Much like fixed and movable do, both of these notations have their uses.</p><p><strong>Scales labeled using multiple zeros in pc integer notation</strong> - Notice each scale is made up of a repeating 4-number pattern. In this example we can see a major scale is based around 0245, Dorian mode is based around 0235, and HW octatonic is based around 0134. - Movable zero is helpful for this kind of thing because we can quickly identify patterns in smaller things, like the scales here. It identifies the specific intervallic framework of a section, based around one note.</p><p>A <em>pitch-class set</em> (pcs) is a collection of pitch classes. <em>Cardinality</em> is the number of pitch classes within a pcs. 0245 is a pcs, and since it has 4 pitch classes in it we call it a tetrachord. We run into problems with some of these cardinality terms because some of the words are the same as ones we associate with tonality.</p><p><strong>What is the application of an empty set?</strong> - We need it for when we start inverting things later. An empty set is the inverse of an aggregate, containing all twelve pitch classes.</p><p>Our “normal” scales and modes would be called septachords, because they contain seven pitch classes.</p><p><strong>Can you apply this system of notation to tonal music?</strong> - You <em>can</em>! The example Dr. Butterfield pulled up in class was Hindemith’s Trumpet Sonata, which he called “a mess to play” but went through using pc integer notation to look at the piece intervallically and not have to transpose as much</p><h2 id="further-reading-22">Further Reading</h2><h3 id="from-open-music-theory-21">From <em>Open Music Theory</em></h3><p>Tonality is highly charged system where <em>scale degrees</em> are endowed with a magnetic or gravitational pull towards other tones. Within the key of C major, B-natural is attracted to the tonic C, other members of the dominant triad are attracted to the tonic triad, and other scale degrees have functions as well. <em>Spelling</em> is extremely important within common-practice tonality. A-flat — as lowered scale degree 6 — leads to G, but G-sharp — as raised scale degree 5 — leads to A. Underlying “scale degree” and “spelling” are two important concepts that will influence our study of post-tonal music.</p><h4 id="octave-equivalence">Octave Equivalence</h4><p>”Scale degree” implies an <em>equivalence</em> between <a href="pitches.html">pitches</a> that are spelled the same but any number of octaves apart. C4 is the same as C3 is the same as C9, and so on. The concept of scale degree, then, has the idea of <em>octave equivalence</em> embedded within it.</p><h4 id="enharmonic-equivalence-1">Enharmonic Equivalence</h4><p>Though <em>octave equivalence</em> is central to our understanding of tonal music, enharmonic equivalence often is not. In the key of C major, A-flat and G-sharp are <em>not</em> equivalent, though in isolation they sound the same. Spelling often indicates tendency: A-flat <em>falls</em> to G and G-sharp <em>rises</em> to A.</p><p>In post-tonal music, enharmonic equivalence is often assumed — with exceptions of course. Because many composers no longer felt constrained by a tonal center, the same gravitational relationships amongst tones that we find in tonal music aren’t important. A-flat and G-sharp, therefore, can be treated as representations of the same thing.</p><h4 id="pitch">Pitch</h4><p><em>Pitches</em> are discrete tones with individual frequencies.

All C-sharps’s and any notes that are enharmonically-equivalent to C-sharp (D-flat, for example) are pitch class 1. And so on: C = 0, C-sharp = 1, D = 2, D-sharp = 3, E = 4, F = 5, F-sharp = 6, G = 7, G-sharp = 8, A = 9, B-flat = 10 (T), and B = 1 1 (E).</p><p>This type of pitch-class, which assumes octave and enharmonic equivalence is easily visualized on a clock-face diagram, like the one below.</p><p><strong>Pitch-Class Space</strong></p><p><a href="/images/postTonal/Pitch-class-Space.jpg"><img src="/images/postTonal/Pitch-class-Space.jpg" /></a></p><h4 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer!</h4><p>Post-tonal music is extremely various. Composers have individual compositional styles, aesthetic goals, and unique conceptions of pitch. All this is to say that you must approach a composition with flexibility. For example: because it is quasi-tonal, Debussy’s music often benefits from a view that does <em>not</em> assume enharmonic equivalence. But sometimes it does. You must rely on your musical intuitions when analyzing this music, and you should also be willing to approach pitch in these compositions from multiple perspectives until you find one that seems most appropriate.</p><h3 id="atonal-glossary">Atonal glossary</h3><p><em>this glossary is far from complete, in the very early stages of being built</em></p><p><strong>collection</strong> – The general term for treating multiple pitch classes as a single entity. Sets, set classes, scales, simultaneities, chords, and intervals are all specific kinds of collections.</p><p><strong>interval class</strong> – The number of semitones between two <em>pitch classes</em>, counted as the shortest distance between them on a clock face. For instance, C and E make an interval class of 4. This is always the case, no matter which <em>pitch</em> is higher or lower, because interval class is concerned only with <em>pitch classes</em>. Interval classes are labeled <strong>ic1</strong>, <strong>ic2</strong>, . . . <strong>ic6</strong>. (There are none smaller than <strong>ic1</strong> or larger than <strong>ic6</strong>.)</p><p><strong>interval vector</strong> – The interval vector of a set class describes all of the interval classes present in a set class. There are six interval classes (1–6). The interval vector gives the number of each of those intervals in order from 1 to 6, within angle brackets. An interval vector of <strong>&lt;101102&gt;</strong> means that the set has one ic1 (semitone/major seventh), no ic2s, one ic3 (minor third/major sixth), one ic4 (major third/minor sixth), no ic5s (perfect fourths), and two ic6s (tritones).</p><p><strong>ordered pitch interval</strong> – The number of semitones from one pitch (not pitch class) to the next. Ascending intervals are denoted by positive numbers, descending intervals by negative numbers. Examples: B4–G5 would have an ordered pitch interval of 8 (eight ascending semitones). B3–G5 would be 20. B4–G4 would be –4.</p><p><strong>ordered pitch-class interval</strong> – The number of <em>ascending</em> semitones from one pitch-class to another. G–B is four semitones, for an ordered PC interval of <strong>4</strong>. B–G is eight ascending semitones, for an ordered PC interval of <strong>8</strong>.</p><p>The ordered pitch-class interval is also the modulo12 version of the ordered pitch interval. For example, B4–G4 is –4 semitones (4 semitones down). mod12(–4) = 8.

B = 11). In atonal music, spelling rarely matters except to make performance easier, so enharmonically equivalent pitch classes are considered identical (C = B-sharp = D-double-flat = 0).</p><p><strong>pitch-class set</strong> – An <em>unordered</em> collection of pitch classes, usually grouped into curly brackets: {C, E, G}, {D, E-flat, G}, or {4, 5, 9}.</p><p><strong>pitch-class set class</strong> or simply <strong>set class</strong> – A category of pitch-class sets that are all related by transposition or inversion. For example, the 12 major triads are all related by transposition. While each major triad is a different pitch-class set, they all belong to the same set class (the same category of sets). Note that minor triads are upside-down major triads (minor third–major third, instead of major third–minor third). Thus since major and minor triads can be related by inversion, they belong to the same set class. Set classes are typically named according to their <em>prime form</em> (see <em>prime form</em> in this glossary).</p><p><strong>prime form</strong> – Since set classes come in as many as 24 different forms (12 transpositions times 2 inversions), one of those forms is chosen as its name or referential form, for ease of categorization. That form is the prime form. The prime form is, in a nutshell, the inversion and rotation of the set class that keeps the pitch classes most tightly packed on and above C (0).</p><p>For help finding the prime form of a set, Jay Tomlin’s <a href="http://www.jaytomlin.com/music/settheory/">set theory calculator</a> can be helpful.

It’s especially important to do it this way now because we’re getting into modulation, and lead sheet will keep you from having to go back and re-do a bunch of work, which might happen if you try and do Roman numerals first. Remember: Roman numerals label function, whereas lead sheet just labels chords. To figure out what the music is doing, first we have to know what we have.</p><p><strong>Pivot modulations (Common chord pivot modulations)</strong> - Three important questions: - Where do you first hear something changing? - How is the change prepared? - What harmonies transition in and out of modulation? - With pivot modulations, you always modulate before you actually hear it. There’s always an overlap with the previous key where the pivot modulation happens–there has to be a functional progression on both sides of the pivot chord - Ideally, your pivot chord is the chord <em>right</em> before you hear the modulation.</p><ul><li><p>In the Haydn example, we don’t hear the modulation until the C# in the bass in the second system. So, the chord in the first half of the same measure (I in G, IV in D) is where we would actually put the pivot chord bracket.</p></li><li><p>Another ex: in the Tchaikovsky example, we hear the modulation in the second to last measure. The chord in the second half of the measure right before it is D major, which is I in the original key and Vi in the new key–a perfect pivot chord! It fits right into a standard circle-of-fifths progression.</p></li><li><p>If you have a lot of V/V - V - V/V - etc. in a row, chances are you have modulated and are now in a new key.

This is possible because vii0 is just V7 without the root. - We had a lot of problems trying to figure out which tone to double in vii0/V. There’s two tendency tones, and with the voicing we wrote out doubling the third results in parallel octaves.

If you try and tonicize a minor chord with vii%7, things will get really screwed up because of where all the voices want to resolve - When trying to correctly resolve a vii07/V, it might be easier to think of the regular vii07 solfege: ti re fa le.

This happens when the leading tone resolves down by third to the fifth of the next chord instead of going upward to the root.

IV is just a ii7 without the root. vii0 is just a V7 without a root. vi stands in for I in deceptive cadences.

These norms include progressions that are more or less common than others. Those norms generate expectations for listeners familiar with the style: if <strong>IV–V</strong> is more common than <strong>IV–VI</strong>, the appearance of a <strong>IV</strong> chord generates an expectation that the next chord is more likely to be <strong>V</strong> than it is to be <strong>VI</strong>.</p><p>In Western classical music, harmonies generally group into three <em>harmonic functions</em> — tonic (T), pre-dominant (P), and dominant (D) — and these functions group together chords that progress to and from other chords in similar ways. For example, since <strong>II</strong> and <strong>IV</strong> are both pre-dominant chords, they will participate in many of the same kinds of chord progressions, and at times can be substituted for each other with only a minimal change to the musical effect.</p><p>On a local level (chord-to-chord progressions), we can summarize the tendencies of these functions with the cycle <strong>T–P–D–T</strong>. That is, harmonies tend to progress through a cyclical progression of those three functions:</p><blockquote><p><strong>T → P → D → T →</strong> and so on . . .</p></blockquote><p>That does not rule out T progressing to D, D progressing to P, etc. But it does mean that those progressions tend to be less common, at least in classical music.</p><p>Higher-level musical structures also impact the norms according to which these harmonic functions progress. For now, we will consider one higher-level structure that influences chord-progression tendencies — the phrase — and we will limit our study to isolated, complete, self-sufficient phrases. This is an idealized, oversimplified setting — like strict voice-leading — that is useful for learning the basics. Some such phrases even exist in real music! But most of the time there are a number of competing factors that influence the chord-progression strategies employed by a composer at any given moment. However, the idealized phrase is a helpful starting point. Future study will explore how classical composers employ harmonic progressions in larger musical works that combine multiple phrases (which are not self-sufficient) into larger themes and movements.</p><h4 id="the-idealized-phrase-1">The idealized phrase</h4><p>The <em>idealized phrase</em> (also called the <em>phrase model</em>) is a single musical phrase that progresses through an entire cycle of harmonic functions, beginning and ending on tonic. (Strict voice-leading exercises are such phrases.) These phrases begin with a point of stability (tonic), move away from that stable point, and then eventually lead to a point of high tension and resolution (an <em>authentic cadence</em>). This pattern of stability–instability–stability, or rest–motion–rest, with a single goal at the end, should be familiar both from species counterpoint and from strict keyboard-style voice-leading. (This pattern also governs large-scale formal structures in classical music.)</p><p>The simplest phrase that exhibits this complete harmonic cycle is a tonic-dominant-tonic progression: <strong>I–V–I.</strong> This phrase begins and ends with the most stable harmony (<strong>I</strong>), and includes an <em>authentic cadence</em> (<strong>V–I</strong>). The <strong>V</strong> is the high point of instability, containing the tendency tone (<em>ti</em>) that most strongly points to the final point of arrival (<em>do</em>, or tonic).</p><p>This harmonic cycle can be expanded by inserting a pre-dominant chord, a destabilized tonic chord, or both, as in the following examples:</p><blockquote><p><strong>I IV V I</strong><br />
<strong>I II V I</strong><br />
<strong>I VI V I</strong><br />
<strong>I VI II V I</strong></p></blockquote><p>In <em>functional bass</em> terms, any harmonic progression that follows the pattern</p><blockquote><p><strong>T1 → (P_) → D5 → T1</strong></p></blockquote><p>can serve as the basis for a complete idealized phrase. (Harmonies in parentheses are optional.)</p><p>Phrases are seldom 3–5 chords long, however, and a harmonic function can be expressed by more than a single chord. Thus we can understand the harmonic functions not simply as chords, but as <em>zones</em> of varying length in a phrase, which can be created by a number of chords or short chord progressions. More generally, then, our idealized musical phrase contains a single progression of functional zones <strong>T → (P) → D → T</strong>, begins with <strong>T1</strong>, and ends with an authentic cadence (<strong>D5–T1</strong>), as seen in the example below.</p><h4 id="triggering-and-prolonging-harmonic-functions-in-an-idealized-phrase-1">Triggering and prolonging harmonic functions in an idealized phrase</h4><p>To establish, or trigger, a harmonic functional zone, composers tend to use <em>a fixed scale degree in the bass</em>. In other words, tonic tends to be triggered by <strong>T1</strong> (always <strong>I</strong>), pre-dominant by <strong>S2</strong> or <strong>S4</strong> (including a variety of <strong>II</strong> and <strong>IV</strong> chords, in in root position or inversions, with and without sevenths), and dominant by <strong>D5</strong> (<strong>V</strong>, with or without a seventh, or a <a href="cadenceTypes"><em>compound cadence</em></a>). These four categories of chords — <strong>T1</strong>, <strong>P2</strong>, <strong>P4</strong>, and <strong>D5</strong> — are called <em>functional chords</em> (because they trigger the function) or <em>cadential chords</em> (because they can participate in a cadence).</p><p>Other chords are often called <em>contrapuntal chords</em> or <em>embellishing chords</em>, and are typically used to <em>prolong</em> a function throughout the zone.</p><p>Functional prolongations are shown in a harmonic analysis by writing/typing T, P, or D underneath the individual chord labels (Roman numerals or functional bass) and extending a line from the beginning of the functional zone to the end.</p><p>The following excerpt is from Mozart’s Piano Sonata in A Major, K. 331, I., mm. 1–4, with a harmonic reduction and analysis provided below the original score. Such an analysis is called an <em>interpreted</em> harmonic analysis, because the harmonies are interpreted according to the way they behave in the phrase, rather than merely labeled. In this phrase, note the following:</p><ul><li>The tonic zone is triggered by a root-position tonic triad (<strong>I</strong> or <strong>T1</strong>).<br />
</li><li>Contrapuntal dominant chords (<strong>D7</strong> — first-inversion dominant chords) create a passing bass motion between the opening <strong>I</strong> chord, the <strong>vi</strong> in m. 3, and the return of <strong>I</strong> in m. 4.</li><li>The <a href="harmonicAnalysis">cadential progression</a> begins in m. 4 with the move from <strong>I</strong> to <strong>ii<sup>6</sup></strong> (<strong>S4</strong>) and then to the cadential six-four and dominant triad (<strong>D5</strong>). Note that the entirety of the cadential progression in m. 4 is made up of <em>cadential chords</em> — chords with fixed scale degrees in the bass.<br />
</li><li>In contrast, the entire tonic-prolongation zone is made up of <em>contrapuntal chords</em> — variable scale degrees in the bass — with the exception of the <strong>I</strong> chord that triggered the tonic function.<br />
</li><li>The <strong>vi</strong> chord is a root-position chord, but still an embellishing chord, while the <strong>ii<sup>6</sup></strong> is an inverted chord, but still a functional/cadential chord. The difference is not the inversion, but the scale degree of the bass.</li></ul><p><a href="/images/harmony/k331-reduction.png"><img src="/images/harmony/k331-reduction.png" /></a></p><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:5yfZxPrcN0hjwzU1OKIsdQ" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe><p><br/></p><p>Not all classical phrases as neatly fit the general trends outlined in this resource. As discussed in <a href="tendency">Style and tendency</a>, the principles of harmonic syntax are both reliable and bendable/breakable, and it is often the music that bends/breaks the “rules” in interesting ways that we care about the most. So in your own analyses, keep these principles in mind as <em>general</em> principles, and simultaneously look for where composers meet these expectations as well as where they break them.</p><h3 id="prolonging-harmonic-functions">Prolonging harmonic functions</h3><p>The following are the primary techniques used to prolong functional zones in an idealized classical phrase. Examples of specific progressions and notational conventions are provided.</p><h4 id="change-of-figure-prolongation">Change-of-figure prolongation</h4><p>A <em>change-of-figure prolongation</em> occurs when the bass repeats (or is sustained, or drops an octave) while one or more of the upper voices change. The function remains the same (T/P/D), but the Roman numeral may change.</p><p>Examples include progressions like <strong>V–V<sup>7</sup></strong> (both <strong>D5</strong>) or <strong>IV–II<sup>6</sup></strong> (both <strong>P4</strong>).</p><h4 id="change-of-bass-prolongation">Change-of-bass prolongation</h4><p>A <em>change-of-bass prolongation</em> occurs when two chords of the same function appear back-to-back, but with different bass pitch classes. In some cases, these are changes of inversion: <strong>I–I<sup>6</sup></strong>, for example. In other cases, the root changes: <strong>I–III</strong> or <strong>IV–II</strong>, for example. What makes these progressions prolongations is that the function remains the same. <strong>I–I<sup>6</sup></strong> prolongs tonic function (<strong>T1–T3</strong>), and <strong>IV–II</strong> prolongs pre-dominant function (<strong>P4–P2</strong>).</p><h4 id="contrapuntal-prolongation-passing-chord">Contrapuntal prolongation – passing chord</h4><p>Many change-of-bass prolongations involve a skip of a third in the bass, such as <strong>I–I<sup>6</sup></strong> (<strong>T1–T3</strong>). Just as in second-species counterpoint a melodic third from downbeat to downbeat invites the use of a weak-beat passing tone, a melodic third in the bass between these two chords invites the use of a <em>passing chord</em>.</p><p>The bass note of a passing chord will fill in the third with stepwise motion. The melody will also often contain passing motion.</p><p>A function is typically prolonged by contrapuntal chords belonging to the function that precedes it in the standard cycle. T is prolonged by D, D by P, and P by T.</p><p>A passing chord that prolongs the above <strong>T1–T3</strong> progression would then be a dominant chord (D precedes T) with scale-degree 2 in the bass (the passing tone between scale degrees 1 and 3): <strong>D2</strong>.</p><iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/music/026277e656" width="100%" height="350" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><br/></p><p>Common <strong>D2</strong> chords are <strong>V<sup>6/4</sup></strong>, <strong>V<sup>4/3</sup></strong>, and <strong>VII<sup>6</sup></strong>. Thus, a <strong>I–I<sup>6</sup></strong> prolongation can involve those as passing chords. The following <strong>T1 D2 T3</strong> progression uses a <strong>viiº6</strong> to prolong tonic. Listen to this example, and then try to change the progression to a properly voiced <strong>I V<sup>6/4</sup> I<sup>6</sup></strong> progression.</p><iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/music/e02e8af4b3" width="100%" height="350" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><br/></p><p>Note that while scale-degree 2 in the bass can support a <strong>II</strong> chord, <strong>II</strong> is pre-dominant, and so it is <em>not</em> used as a passing chord to prolong tonic.</p><h4 id="contrapuntal-prolongation-incomplete-neighbor-chord">Contrapuntal prolongation – incomplete neighbor chord</h4><p>In <a href="secondSpecies.html">second-species counterpoint</a>, variety could come by using a <em>substitution</em> in place of a passing tone. This leap of a fourth followed by step in the opposite direction still outlines a third from downbeat to downbeat, but offers a break from too much stepwise motion in the counterpoint.</p><p>In harmonic writing, the same effect is obtained by an <em>incomplete neighbor chord</em>. The bass follows the same incomplete-neighbor pattern as the second-species counterpoint, and the function of the contrapuntal chord is the same as its passing-chord counterpart. Thus instead of a passing motion of <strong>T1 D2 T3</strong>, a substitution pattern in the bass would produce <strong>T1 D4 T3</strong>. (In Roman numerals, that progression would almost invariably be <strong>I V<sup>4/2</sup> I<sup>6</sup></strong>, as it is in the following example.)</p><iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/music/51a20e2c7a" width="100%" height="350" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><br/></p><h4 id="contrapuntal-prolongation-complete-neighbor-chord">Contrapuntal prolongation – complete neighbor chord</h4><p>Just as a <em>neighbor tone</em> in second- or third-species counterpoint could be used to ornament a single tone and return to it, a <em>neighbor chord</em> uses a neighbor-tone motion in the bass to prolong a function and return to the original bass pitch. The function of a neighbor chord follows the same principle as the passing or incomplete neighbor chord. Following are some examples of neighbor-chord prolongations:</p><ul><li><strong>T1 D7 T1</strong><br />
</li><li><strong>T3 D4 T3</strong><br />
</li><li><strong>P4 T3 P4</strong><br />

Likewise, a <em>divider chord</em> takes a large leap between bass notes in a change-of-bass prolongation (or a simple octave leap in the bass) and divides it into two smaller leaps.</p><p>Divider chords almost always prolong tonic function, and can do so using either pre-dominant or dominant dividers. The most common divider-chord prolongations are:</p><ul><li><strong>T1 D5 T1</strong> (<strong>I V<sup>(7)</sup> I</strong>), where the bass ascends or descends an octave between <strong>T1</strong> chords.<br />
</li><li><strong>T1 P4 T1</strong> (<strong>I IV I</strong>), where the bass ascends or descends an octave between <strong>T1</strong> chords.<br />
</li><li><strong>T1 P6 T3</strong> (<strong>I IV<sup>6</sup> I<sup>6</sup></strong> or <strong>I IV<sup>6</sup> III</strong>), dubbed the <em>champagne progression</em> by theorist Gene Biringer, because it is “the progression you pull out when you want to impress a date.”</li></ul><p>Following is a champagne progression. Which version is it (<strong>I<sup>6</sup></strong> or <strong>III</strong>)? What one thing must change in order to form the other version? What default voice-leading rule is “broken” in this progression? (Note, because of rule conflicts, this progression will always break that rule, and it will always have these scale degrees in the melody.)</p><iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/music/6a403a3d21" width="100%" height="350" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><br/></p><p>In the case of <strong>T1 D5 T1</strong> and <strong>T1 P4 T1</strong>, the same harmonic progression can occur without the bass changing register. In other words, the bass leaps from <em>do</em> to <em>sol</em> or <em>fa</em>, but returns to the original bass note. Instead of dividing a large leap, the bass note of the intervening chord looks like an <em>embellishing tone</em> from third species. (In third-species counterpoint, an <em>embellishing tone</em> ornaments another tone by leaping to another consonance — usually a third or fourth away — and returning to the original tone.) Thus, what would otherwise be a <em>divider chord</em> is instead an <em>embellishing chord</em>.</p><p>Following is a <strong>T1 D5 T1</strong> <em>divider</em> prolongation.

When such a progression fails to produce a proper cadence — that is, it ends with contrapuntal chords such as <strong>D7–T1</strong> or <strong>D4–T3</strong>, or uses a “deceptive resolution” <strong>D5–T6</strong> (<strong>V–VI</strong>) in place of the cadential <strong>D5–T1</strong> — the progression is called a <em>subsidiary harmonic progression</em> (this term comes from Edward Aldwell &amp; Carl Schachter; Steven Laitz calls the same progression an <em>embedded phrase model</em>). It is “subsidiary” (or “embedded”) because instead of occupying the whole phrase, it is subsidiary to (or embedded in) a larger progression.</p><p>These subsidiary progressions <em>always prolong tonic</em>. They are labeled in an analysis by following the initial T with a line:</p><blockquote><p><strong>T—————</strong></p></blockquote><p>For instance, consider the following possible harmonic progression for a phrase:</p><iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/music/69e6b9acb9" width="100%" height="350" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><br/></p><p>The first progression through the <strong>T–S–D–T</strong> cycle does not produce a cadence when it returns to T.

The bass line <em>do</em>–<em>te</em>–<em>le</em>–<em>sol</em> is harmonized by <strong>T1 D7 P6 D5</strong> (usually <strong>i v<sup>6</sup> iv<sup>6</sup> V</strong> — the chord qualities are important in this progression, called the “lament”).

This creates a pattern of strong and weak beats and consequently a series of rules that are defined by the contrapuntal place in the measure.</p><ul><li>Strong beats occur “on the beat,” meaning that they align with every change of pitch in the cantus firmus.</li><li>Weak beats are “off the beat” meaning that they occur in the middle of each pitch in the cantus firmus.</li></ul><h4 id="harmonic-intervals">Harmonic Intervals:</h4><p>Second species counterpoint also allows for a key element that is not an option in first species: dissonance. Strong beats must still only use consonances. Weak beats may use dissonance, although there are many restrictions.</p><p>For our studies, we will start the counterpoint with a rest on the strong beat followed by a perfect interval on the weak beat. From that point forward, you will follow these harmonic rules:</p><p>Consonances: - may occur at any point - strong beats will always be consonant - imperfect consonances are generally preferred because they do not cause issues when used in parallel motion</p><p>Dissonances: - only on weak beats - approached by step</p><p>Starting and Ending Intervals: - starts on P5, P8, or unison - ends on P5 or P8</p><p>Perfect Intervals - approached by parallel motion - same perfect interval (e.g. P5 to P5) can never occur consecutively, nor can they occur on consecutive strong beats</p><h4 id="motion-between-lines">Motion Between Lines</h4><p>In discussing counterpoint, you may have noticed that the restricted melodic options create a variety of “standard” melodic shapes. We can describe a few of these here, and this will be explored fully when we begin studying non-chord tones in diatonic harmony in Unit 9.</p><p><strong>passing motion</strong> (P): motion approached by step and left by step in the same direction</p><p><strong>neighboring motion</strong> (N): motion approached by step and left by step in the opposite direction</p><ul><li>Note that these neighboring and passing motion are the only types of motion that allow you to use dissonant intervals in second species counterpoint.<ul><li>Dissonance using neighboring motion is only allowed using a lower neighbor, never an upper neighbor.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>appoggiatura</strong> (APP): motion approached by leap and left by step in the opposite direction</p><p>Now that we have the tools to understand and classify harmonies, we can analyze almost any piece of music written using the diatonic system. Of course, analysis implies a deeper understanding than simply labeling chords, but to begin this process, we must start with that basic idea.</p><p>When looking at a piece of music, the first step to labeling chords must be to sort which tones are functional and which are embellishments. The non-chord tones described in the previous topic can be combined with our rudimentary knowledge of common chord progressions in order to help in this differentiation. As always, chorales are the easiest place to begin understanding these patterns, but these principles can be applied to any piece of diatonic music because these non-chord tones reflect the patterns necessary to navigate tertiary harmony.</p><p>In short, creating harmony from stacked thirds produces a limited number of functional melodic patterns. Non-chord tones help us identify these.</p><h3 id="examples-2">Examples</h3><p>TBD</p><p>We have now studied the full array of part-writing errors for four-part chorale style compositions.

From this, we derive primary harmonic functions such as tonic, dominant, and pre-dominant as well as embellishing functions such as passing, pedal, and cadential. Even the exceptions to these can be viewed as functional substitutions (e.g. deceptive progressions).</p><p>At its core, mode mixture borrows altered tones from parallel modes – thus altering chord <em>qualities</em> – but retains standard chord function. If a diatonic chord would have a pre-dominant function, altering an individual tone by a half-step will not alter the function. It creates color and often <em>strengthens</em> the voice-leading by changing whole-step resolutions into half-step resolutions. Moreover, if a chord functions as an embellishing chord such as a passing or pedal chord, then it will retain that function even if one or two pitches are borrowed from a parallel mode.</p><p>Even seemingly inexplicable choices can be explained – such as the ii<sup>ø7</sup> from the chord progression above – if you look at the voice-leading and compare it to standard diatonic function. 1. The ii<sup>ø7</sup> is inserted into the position where we would normally expect a dominant function. 2. If you compare the pitches within ii<sup>ø7</sup> to the pitches of vii<sup>o7</sup>, you will realize that three of the pitches are the same (D, F, and A-flat) and the remaining pitch only changes by a half-step (B to C). In this progression, the C works best when it acts as an anticipation of the tonic chord, and this strengthens the voice-leading resolutions of ii<sup>ø7</sup>. Therefore, the ii<sup>ø7</sup> can be viewed as an altered dominant function chord.</p><p>With this in mind, look at the following reduction of an excerpt from Mahler’s Symphony No. 2.

If the chord operates as a functional substitution (tonic, dominant, pre-dominant), then it is better to label it as a borrowed chord. If each member of the chord functions solely for smooth voice-leading purposes, then it should be labeled as a borrowed chord with an alternate function such as a passing or pedal chord.</p><p>In the example above, most will hear the first iteration as a I-IV-iv-I progression.

This flexibility comes with the drawback of making comparison difficult, because there is no guarantee that a pc set is in the same order. For this reason, we use normal form to ensure that our comparisons between pc sets are built in a consistent manner. This is also why you should always normalize a pc set after inverting it.</p><h3 id="how-many-are-there">How many are there?</h3><p>If you were to group all of the unique transpositions and inversions of a pc set, how many permutations would there be? To explore these ideas, first write out all unique inversions and transpositions of the following prime form pc set. This set represents a typical pc set in that every transposition and inversion is unique. - (014)</p><p>Because there are twelve possible starting pitches and for both the starting set and its inversion, there are typically twenty-four possible pc sets within a set class. And because we use normal form to represent each pc set within a set class, this means there is <em>only</em> one arrangement of the pc set for each starting pitch. (If every unique order of pitch classes was considered as well, there would be vastly more options depending on the cardinality of (i.e. the number of pitch classes within) a pc set.</p><h3 id="set-class">Set class</h3><p>Theoretically, we can determine whether any two pc sets are related by transposition, inversion, or both. To try this, study the following four trichords. How are they related? What method(s) will you use to find the relationships? As you work through this, keep track of the manipulations you make to find compare them. Hint: It will be helpful to make sure that you are always working with the normal form. - (2,9,6) - (8,4,1) - (e,2,7) - (6,2,8)</p><p>For fairly simple trichords such as these, there are a variety of methods you could use to compare them. Some people will write them using traditional notation on a staff, yet others will attempt to visualize them on clock or number line. These visual methods may work to a degree for a simple trichord but fail on two accounts - It is difficult to scale to larger, denser pc sets. - It is difficult to see the relationship for anything other than transposition.</p><p>For these reasons, set theory has a system to reduce and compare any pc set into a group of all related pc sets. Any two pc sets that are related by transposition and/or inversion are considered to be part of the same <em>set class</em>. All of the trichords listed above belong to the same set class, and we can show this using simple manipulations.</p><p>If we put each of them into normal form, we get: - [2,6,9] - [1,4,8] - [7,e,2] - [2,6,8]</p><p>Just by doing this, it easy to use addition and subtraction to show that the first and third trichords are directly related by transposition: - T<sub>5</sub>[2,6,9] = [7,e,2])</p><p>And the second and fourth are related in the same manner - T<sub>1</sub>[1,4,8] = [2,6,8]</p><p>Because an inverted pc set often has no common tones with its original pc set, it is more difficult to see inverted relationships. For this, it would be easier to create a “standard” around which we can examine all pc sets in normal form within a set class. For this, let’s try reducing both sets above to begin with 0. If we do this the first pair of pc sets becomes [0,4,7] and the second pair becomes [0,3,7]. You can see that they are similar in that they both use pitch classes 0 and 7, but are they related by inversion? Let’s try inverting one of them, normalizing it, and then reducing it to a normal form that begins on 0.</p><ul><li>[2,6,9] reduces to [0,4,7] (by transposing by -2)</li><li>[0,4,7] inverts to [0,8,5]</li><li>[0,8,5] normalizes to [5,8,0]</li><li>[5,8,0] reduces to [0,3,7] (by transposing by -5)</li></ul><p>Therefore, we can see that all four of our original trichords are related by transposition and inversion.

These two trichords represent the reduced trichord of both inversions of this pc set. To determine which is prime form, we apply the same tie-breakers that we used when determining normal form: start by comparing the outermost intervals and then work your way inward. Both of these trichords have an outer interval of 7, but [0,3,7] has a smaller second interval (i.e. 0 to 3 is smaller than 0 to 4). Therefore, the prime form of <strong>all</strong> of the above trichords is:</p><ol start="37" type="1"><li></li></ol><p>Notice the notation of prime form.

The simplest way to measure the distance between two intervals would be to measure the distance by the shortest possible interval–in this case, a half-step (minor second). While easily understandable, this method does not relate to our concept of tonality. Instead, counting half-steps creates <em>interval-classes</em> in which intervals are considered equal regardless of the pitches. For example, the interval of <code>G</code> to <code>D-flat</code> has six half-steps which is identical to the interval from <code>G</code> to <code>C-sharp</code>. Both even use the same pitch-classes, however, if you put those into the context of the scales from the previous unit, you will hopefully associate these two intervals with different key centers. (<code>G</code> to <code>D-flat</code> is strongly associated with the key of A-flat major/minor, whereas <code>C-sharp</code> to <code>G</code> likely implies D major/minor.) The context of these two intervals is critical in determining their function in tonal harmony, so we use a system that differentiates between the two.</p><p>In a diatonic labeling system, every interval has a <em>size</em> and a <em>quality</em>. For example, in a minor second, labeled <code>m2</code>, the <strong>m</strong> indicates the <em>quality</em> of the interval and the <strong>2</strong> indicates the <em>size</em> of the interval. Let’s look at how we find <em>size</em> first.</p><h4 id="interval-size">Interval size</h4><p>Interval <em>size</em> can be determined by considering either: - lines and spaces - letter names</p><p>Both these methods will correctly identify interval size, although counting letter names yields results without requiring the presence (or visualization) of a staff. Do not forget that you must include both letters when counting. (e.g. The ascending interval from A to C is a third, because you must count A (1), B (2), and C (3).)</p><p>This means that any interval that has the same two letters, regardless of accidentals or key signatures, will always have the same <em>size</em>. Using our previous example, the <em>size</em> of the interval between <code>G</code> and <code>D-flat</code> is a fifth: G (1), A (2), B (3), C (4), and D (5). We can change the bottom note to any other <code>G</code> (<code>G-sharp, G-flat</code>, etc.) and the top note to any other <code>D</code> (<code>D-sharp, D-natural</code>, etc.), but the <em>size</em> of that interval will <strong>always</strong> be a fifth. Yet if we exchange the <code>D-flat</code> for its enharmonic equivalent, <code>C-sharp</code>, we alter the letters and turn the <em>size</em> of the interval into a fourth.</p><h4 id="interval-quality">Interval quality</h4><p>In the Western music notation system, interval <em>quality</em> is difficult to examine without beginning to think about our concept of tonality and keys, because it is designed to describe tonal intervals. It is easiest to understand <em>qualities</em> of intervals by comparing them to the major scale, so we will look at that below. If you do not yet feel comfortable with scales, however, you may look at the <a href="02-int-scales-keys/a2-intervals.html">Further Reading</a> of this topic to find a useful method from the writers of <em>Open Music Theory</em>.</p><p>The most common and straightforward method for learning interval <em>quality</em> compares the interval to a major scale:</p><ol type="1"><li>Find the size of the interval by counting through the letter between the two pitches.</li></ol><ul><li>Remember that you must include the starting and ending pitches in your counting.</li><li>Remember that size is independent of quality, so none of the following steps will affect the interval size.</li></ul><ol type="1"><li>To being finding the quality of the interval, consider the bottom pitch of the interval as the tonic of a major scale.</li><li>If the top pitch of the interval is a note that naturally exists in the major scale built off the lower pitch, it is either a major or perfect interval, depending on the <em>size</em> of the interval.</li></ol><ul><li>Unisons, fourths, fifths, and octaves occur naturally in the major scale as <em>perfect</em> intervals.</li><li>Seconds, thirds, sixths, and sevenths occur naturally in the major scale as <em>major</em> intervals.</li></ul><ol type="1"><li>Any alteration from the basic major and perfect intervals can then be labeled by looking at the direction of alteration and the number of half-steps that the interval was altered.</li></ol><ul><li>If the original interval is <em>perfect</em>:<ul><li>Raising the interval by a half-step creates an <em>augmented</em> interval.</li><li>Lowering the interval by a half-step creates a <em>diminished</em> interval.</li></ul></li><li>If the original interval is <em>major</em>:<ul><li>Raising the interval by a half-step creates an <em>augmented</em> interval.</li><li>Lowering the interval by a half-step creates a <em>minor</em> interval.</li><li>Lowering the interval by a 2 half-steps creates a <em>diminished</em> interval.</li></ul></li></ul><h5 id="quality-hierarchies">Quality hierarchies</h5><p>From this, our interval can be grouped into two distinct hierarchies: - The “Perfect” intervals - Interval <em>sizes</em> of 1, 4, 5, and 8 can only have the <em>qualities</em> of perfect (P), augmented (A), or diminished (d). - The “Major/minor” intervals - Interval <em>sizes</em> of 2, 3, 6, and 7 can only have the <em>qualities</em> of major (M), minor (m), augmented (A), or diminished (d).</p><p>Note that even though <em>perfect</em> intervals use a different hierarchy than <em>major/minor</em> intervals, both hierarchies share the terms <em>diminished</em> and <em>augmented</em>.</p><h5 id="interval-quality-practice">Interval quality practice</h5><p>Let’s practice some examples using this method: - <code>C</code> to <code>E</code>: - Counting the letter names confirms that the <em>size</em> is a third - C (1), D (2), E (3) - If we consider the lower pitch, <code>C</code>, as the tonic of a major scale, we can use the C-major scale to find that the naturally occurring <code>E</code> in the key of C major is <code>E-natural</code>. - Because this is an interval size of a third, we must use the <em>major</em> hierarchy, so therefore, <code>E-natural</code> would be a **major third *(M3)<strong> above C. - <code>D</code> to <code>G-sharp</code> - Counting the letter names confirms that the <em>size</em> is a fourth - D (1), E (2), F (3), G (4) - By setting the lower pitch, <code>D</code>, as a tonic, we can use the D-major scale to find that the naturally occurring <code>G</code> in the key of D major is <code>G-natural</code>. Therefore, <code>G-natural</code> is a perfect 4th above D, because all naturally occurring intervals in a major scale are either perfect or major depending on their size. - Because <code>G-sharp</code> is one half-step above the <em>perfect</em> interval, we go one step up the “perfect” hierarchy to find that this interval is an </strong>augmented fourth (A4)<strong>. - <code>F</code> to <code>E-double-flat</code> - Counting the letter names confirms that the <em>size</em> is a seventh (F, G, A, B C, D, E = 7) - By using the lower pitch, <code>F</code>, as <code>do</code>, we can use the F-major scale to find that the naturally occurring <code>E</code> in the key of F major is <code>E-natural</code>. - Because this is a seventh, we must use the <em>major</em> hierarchy, so therefore, <code>E-natural</code> would be a M7 above F. - Because <code>E-double-flat</code> is two half-steps below the <em>major</em> interval, we go two steps down the major hierarchy to find that this interval is an </strong>diminished seventh (d7)**.</p><h4 id="melodic-vs.-harmonic">Melodic vs. Harmonic</h4><p>Melodic and harmonic intervals are one of the simplest concepts to understand, although the describing them can be problematic. At first, students often describe harmonic intervals as occurring “at the same time” while melodic intervals occur “at different times.” While this is a simple explanation, we must be careful in how we apply the terms <em>interval</em> and <em>pitches</em>. The interval is the space between the two pitches, therefore, the interval cannot occur “at the same time” or “at different times.” The pitches can occur simultaneously or consecutively, but the interval always exists as a fixed measurement. This is how we can label harmonic and melodic intervals using the same system.</p><p>I recommend that we think of intervals as existing on either a horizontal or vertical axis, because we can visualize axes (as in the plural of axis) easily on musical staff notation. If two pitches occur “at the same time,” they will be aligned vertically on a staff. If two pitches occur consecutively, they will represent unique points on a horizontal line that runs parallel to the lines of the staff. This may seem overly technical, but it is an important distinction.</p><p>A final note: melodic intervals can have two modifiers attached to them, <em>ascending</em> or <em>descending</em>. Ascending intervals start with the lower of the two pitches, whereas descending intervals start on the the higher pitch. Harmonic intervals cannot be ascending or descending.</p><h4 id="simple-vs.-compound">Simple vs. Compound</h4><p>Simple intervals include any interval that is equal to or smaller than an octave. Compound intervals are any interval larger than an octave.</p><p>To label compound intervals, we count letter names as we do for simple intervals. We can find a compound interval by adding 7 to any simple interval. For example, a 2nd becomes a 9th. A 4th becomes an 11th. An 8ve (octave) becomes a 15th.</p><p>Conversely, if we see a compound interval, we can find its simple equivalent by subtracting 7. A 12th is a 5th plus an octave. A 10th is a 3rd plus an octave.</p><p>You may ask why we don’t add eight considering that we are adding an octave. The answer lies in how we find the <em>size</em> of intervals. When we find interval <em>size</em>, we count the letter names <em>and include the starting pitch</em>. When we add an octave, we have already used the top note so we are missing one letter. For example, a fifth from A to E includes the letters <code>A B C D E</code>. If we add an octave, the first <code>E</code> was already included in the first interval of the 5th, so we are only adding seven letters <code>F G A B C D E</code>.</p><h4 id="chromatic-vs.-diatonic">Chromatic vs. Diatonic</h4><p>The difference between chromatic and diatonic is probably the most straightforward of interval classifications in usage, but it has a level of nuance that students often miss and causes confusion later. Simply put, <em>diatonic</em> intervals contain only pitches that belong to the <strong>current</strong> tonality, whereas <em>chromatic</em> intervals contain at least one pitch that does not belong to the current tonality.</p><p>Of course, this relies on you knowing what the current tonality is. In many situations, this means that you can find chromatic pitches, and therefore chromatic interals, wherever you find a note with an accidental. So if the key signature matches the current tonality–for example, the key signature has two sharps and the tonality is D major–any pitch that does not have an accidental is a <em>chromatic</em> pitch and all intervals formed with that pitch would be chromatic intervals.</p><h4 id="inversions-1">Inversions</h4><p>An easy way to think of inverted intervals is to consider an inversion to be an interval in which one pitch is fixed and the other is transposed by one octave toward the fixed pitch.</p><h5 id="inverting-size">Inverting size</h5><p>To determine the <em>size</em> of an inverted interval, it is easiest to simply memorize the interval pairs, so: - 4 inverts to 5 and vice versa - 3 inverts to 6 and vice versa - 2 inverts to 7 and vice versa - 1 inverts to 8 and vice versa</p><p>Each of these pairs adds up to nine, so if you ever forget or doubt your memorization, you can find an inversion by simply subtracting the interval size from 9. For example, if there is a written 3rd, subtract 3 from 9 to find that the inversion of a 3rd is a 6th. Note that for compound intervals, you must use subtract from 16 or use negative numbers and absolute values. Because of this, it is easier to reduce compound intervals to a simple interval before inverting.</p><h5 id="inverting-quality">Inverting quality</h5><p>To find the qualities of inverted intervals, you simply need to memorize three pairs: - diminished becomes augmented and vice versa - major becomes minor and vice versa - perfect becomes perfect and vice versa</p><p>We will explore the mathematical underpinnings of why inversions form these pairs in Unit 23.</p><p>In looking at triads and seventh chords, we have only learned how to label and classify these musical objects without specifying a particular root. A major triad or a dominant seventh chord can be built off any of the twelve pitch-classes, and each of the pitch-classes have multiple options depending on which enharmonic equivalent you choose as the root.</p><p>There is one commonly-used method that allows us to label specific triads and seventh chords as well as their inversions: <em>leadsheet notation</em>. This is also sometimes referred to as <em>slash-chord notation</em>, <em>jazz chord symbols</em>, or <em>pop chord symbols</em>. This system for labeling chords is most commonly seen in jazz and pop music, but it is useful to all musicians because it is an efficient system for communicating chords <em>of any complexity</em>.</p><p>Even after we introduce Roman numeral analysis and harmonic function in Unit 6, we will continue to use leadsheet notation to provide a harmonic overview of complex analyses before we try to assign harmonic function and relationships. For example, if we have a C major triad and an F major triad and no other context, we cannot be sure of their key and function, so Roman numeral notation is not very useful. For those with a knowledge of diatonic function, it would seem most likely that these two chords belong to F major, but they could also exist diatonically in the keys of C major, D minor, A minor, as well as various modes. When analyzing harmonically ambiguous functions, it is critical to have a shorthand for labeling chords, so that we can look at the overview rather than re-analyzing each chord every time we come to a section of music.</p><h4 id="labeling-triads">Labeling triads</h4><p>Using the examples below: - determine the standard methods for labeling all chord qualities - match these to our current labels (e.g. Major minor (Mm) chords are the same as a dominant seventh chord which is then labeled as…) - determine the method for denoting inversions - match these inversions to their corresponding inversion figures for both triads and seventh chords</p><p>{% capture ex1 %}X:1 T:Leadsheet notation of triads M:2/4 L:1/2 K:C clef=bass “Bb+ (or Bbaug)”[_B,,D,^F,]| “Bb”[_B,,D,F,]| “Bbmin (or Bb-)”[_B,,_D,F,]| “Bbdim (or Bbo)”[_B,,_D,_F,]||{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“1” abc=ex1 %}</p><h4 id="labeling-seventh-chords">Labeling seventh chords</h4><p>{% capture ex2 %}X:2 T:Leadsheet notation of seventh chords T:Everything other than the chord’s root is typically written in superscript T:————— M:2/4 L:1/2 K:C “Dmaj7”[D<sup>FA</sup>c]| “D7”[D^FAc]| “Dm7 (or Dmin7)”[DFAc]| “D/o7 or Dm7(b5)”[DF_Ac]| “Do7(or Ddim7)”[DF_A_c]|| w: major~seventh dominant~seventh minor~seventh half~diminished fully~diminished{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“2” abc=ex2 %}</p><h4 id="labeling-inversions">Labeling inversions</h4><p>{% capture ex3 %}X:3 T:Inversions in leadsheet notation T:————— M:2/4 L:1/2 K:C “D7”[D^FAc]| “D7/F#”[d^FAc]| “D7/A”[d^fAc]| “D7/C”[D^FAC]| w:root~position first~inversion second~inversion third~inversion w:7~(7/5/3) 6/5~(6/5/3) 4/3~(6/4/3) 4/2~(6/4/2){% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“3” abc=ex3 %}</p><h3 id="conclusions-59">Conclusions</h3><h4 id="basic-leadsheet-notation">Basic leadsheet notation</h4><p>The general naming system that we have used thus far allows us to talk about general categories of triads and seventh chords, but does not allow us to specify the exact root of a chord. Leadsheet notation is a shorthand method written above the staff that specifies a chord’s root and quality. Leadsheet notation never had a centralized authority, so over many decades, it evolved various ways to denote the same chord qualities.</p><p>Leadsheet notation consists of a note name followed by a chord shorthand. The note name denotes the root of the chord, and is most commonly an upper-case letter regardless of the chord’s quality. Some systems use a lower-case letter for minor chords, but this is less common and is problematic for letters that have similar upper-case and lower-case versions such as <code>c</code>. (And of course can be exacerbated if the writer’s penmanship is poor.) For our course, I will always use an upper-case root in my leadsheet notation.</p><p>The chord quality shorthand can vary greatly, so we have listed the more common possibilities below for chords with a root of C. I have listed them in my order of preference – again taking student penmanship into account.

To use slashchords, you use standard standard leadsheet notation followed by a slash (/) and then the <em>bass</em> note. This allows you to show any inversion. For example:</p><ul><li>C<sup>7</sup>/E is a C dominant seventh chord in first-inversion.</li><li>C<sup>7</sup>/G is a C dominant seventh chord in second-inversion.</li><li>C<sup>7</sup>/B♭ is a C dominant seventh chord in third-inversion.</li></ul><h4 id="extensions-and-using-sub-vs.-add">Extensions and Using Sub vs. Add</h4><p>Using the example below, you should: - define <em>extended harmonies</em> by contrasting the chords below from the chords above - find the key factor in determining a <em>sus</em> chord - understand the difference between using <em>sub</em> and <em>add</em> in your leadsheet notation</p><p>{% capture ex4 %}X:4 T:Labeling extensions in leadsheet notation T:————— M:2/4 L:1/2 K:C “D13”[D^FAcegb]| “D6/9”[D^FAeB]^c/2| “Dsus7”[DGAc]| “D9 or D7(add9)”[D^FAce]| “Dm7(add b5)”[DF_a=Ac]| “Dm7(sub b5)”[DF_Ac]|| w:_ _ implied{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“4” abc=ex4 %}</p><h3 id="conclusions-60">Conclusions</h3><h4 id="extended-harmonies-in-leadsheet-notation">Extended harmonies in leadsheet notation</h4><p>As tertian harmony evolved from its earliest roots, some composers began adding pitches to chords beyond the chordal seventh. We will use the term <em>extended harmony</em> to refer to these chords, but in common usage, this term can also encompass chords that do not adhere to standard triad and seventh chord structures.</p><p>For chords that extend beyond the seventh chord, we typically use the terms <em>ninth</em> for the second scale degree, <em>eleventh</em> for the fourth scale degree, and <em>thirteenth</em> for the sixth scale degree, because these extensions are a continuation of stacked thirds continuing above the seventh chord. A Cmin<sup>11</sup> implies that it has the normal minor seventh chord with both the diatonic ninth and eleventh added above it.</p><p>As with standard leadsheet notation for seventh chords, if you have a number alone, it always implies a dominant seventh chord with extensions. A C<sup>13</sup> is a dominant seventh chord built on the root C with extensions up to the thirteenth. The only notable exception to this rule is the <sup>6/9</sup> chord; the shorthand in this case implies a major seventh even though there is no signifier other than the two numbers.</p><h4 id="sus-chords"><em>Sus</em> chords</h4><p>As we move into studying the ways that composers embellish their music later in the course, we will study <em>suspensions</em>–a note that <em>does not belong to a chord</em>, but instead adds extra tension and color before resolving downward by step. In modern music however, there exists a standalone chord called a sus chord, which resembles the non-chord tone suspension of previous eras, but because the sus chord can be used without resolution, it has its own leadsheet notation.</p><p>Csus</p><p>Any time that you see the abbreviation <em>sus</em> added to a chord in leadsheet notation, this implies that there is no chordal third. Instead, you will use the diatonic pitch that is a fourth above the <em>root</em>. So for a Csus, you will replace the E that would normally be present in a C major triad with an F. This would not change even if the bass note was altered; it will always replace the chordal third with the step above it. Any further alterations are best handled using…</p><h4 id="sub-and-add"><em>Sub</em> and <em>Add</em></h4><p>The two commands <em>sub</em> and <em>add</em> are useful when writing leadsheet notation of non-standard chords. Admittedly, these will not be used much in diatonic harmony, but understanding their usage now will help when we move into chromatic harmonies.</p><p>Because triads and seventh chords are built in thirds, every third above the root has a predetermined quality based on the chord quality and root. If you would like to alter one of those chordal members, you can use the <em>sub</em> followed by an altered chordal member to imply that you are <em>replacing</em> that chordal member. For example, the alternate method for half-diminished seventh chords comes from this. Because a diminished triad is a minor triad with a lowered fifth chordal member, you could use the leadsheet notation for a minor seventh chord and substitute a lowered 5th. This would look like:</p><p>Cmin<sup>7(sub b5)</sup></p><p>Admittedly, this method for notating half-diminished seventh chords is common enough that it is not required to use “sub” in this particular example, but this is still an excellent example of the proper way to use the sub command.</p><p><em>Add</em>, on the other hand, does not alter any of the chordal members, but instead adds an extra chord tone. If you would like to add a raised ninth to a dominant 7th chord without altering the third, you could use:</p><p>C<sup>7(add#9)</sup></p><p>If you master these two commands in your leadsheet notation, it is possible to denote any combination of altered pitches and substitutions for even the most complicated music. Of course, this assumes that the music still has at least its basic roots in tertian harmony, but even through the current day, almost all Western music does.</p><p>Having just explored how changing the tempo of a piece written in 3/x can change the classfication between compound and simple, it should be no surprise that aural interpretation of meter is a subjective process. Many factors play a role in determining how a listener perceives a meter including tempo, accented beats, melodic patterns, and previously established “grooves.”</p><p>The examples on the following page will help you explore a few of the many ways in which a composer or performer can alter the perception of meter.</p><h3 id="syncopation">Syncopation</h3><p><em>Syncopation</em> occurs when a note emphasizes the “weak” beats of a measure, but as discussed in Topic 4b, meter is based on our perception and is therefore a subjective phenomenon. Listen to the first three bars of the following example without looking at the music. Try tapping your perceived pulse until the end of the excerpt, and then see if your mental construction of the rhythm matches the piece.</p><p>{% capture ex1 %}X:1 T:Syncopation M:4/4 L:1/4 Q:1/4=90 K:C V:1 z4| z4| z4|| g c d e| g c/2 d e/2- e/2c/4d/4| e4|] V:2 z/2 G G G G/2-| G/2G/2 G G c/2G/4F/4| G4|| z/2 G G G G/2-| G/2G/2 G G c/2G/4F/4| G4|]{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“1” abc=ex1 %}</p><h4 id="conclusions-61">Conclusions</h4><p>The very idea of strong and weak beats relies on a recognizable, steady pulse. Even though the first line above is clearly written in a syncopated pattern that begins on the &amp; of 1, most listeners hear the first pitch as the downbeat because it is the first pitch they hear. However, when the top line is added in the fourth measure, it becomes possible to hear the bottom line as syncopated because an earlier reference has been established. In general, a listener will hear the first sound of a piece of music as a downbeat unless other contextual clues–such as melodic shape, note shape, or accents–lead them to think otherwise.</p><p>Syncopation occurs when emphasis is put on the “weak” beats of the meter, but the above example shows the subjectivity of this. If a listener listens to the example without looking at the notation, it would be impossible to know that the example starts on an offbeat. It is therefore worth noting that strong and weak beats are determined by <em>context</em>, not by meter. Once the top line is added to the excerpt, the listener may still hear the bottom line as taking place on the beat if they listened to it without looking at the notation, while some may “switch” the beat in their mind to make the bottom line a strongly syncopated rhythm. Syncopation can occur within a single line if the beat is established first and then weak beat rhythms are introduced, but this is still an example of establishing the strong beats for the listener before syncopation can begin.</p><h3 id="meters-with-different-beat-lengths-but-identical-numbers-of-divisions">Meters with different beat lengths but identical numbers of divisions</h3><p>The next example contains a rhythmic pattern scored in two different meters.

Aurally, both parts sounded identical regardless of the meter, but when listening and not looking at the excerpt, most listeners feel that the piece is in a compound duple meter. This demonstrates that even though a pattern can be written in various meters, there are other factors that can strongly pull toward a particular meter. In this case, the motif is melodically grouped into two groups of three, so it pulls most of the listeners toward a 6/8 feel. One may hear this in 3/4, but this would require other factors such as accents, silence, and tempo to affect how the listener perceives the passage.</p><p>It should be noted that many composers rely on using meters to evoke particular rhythmic biases in the performer, so it is disingenuous to say that meter is <em>entirely</em> subjective. Stravinsky was well-known to write the same passage in various meters (e.g. <em>Rite of Spring</em>, <em>L’histoire du Soldat</em>), so a good performer is aware of what the meter is trying to tell them.</p><h3 id="how-previous-material-affects-perception">How previous material affects perception</h3><p>Listen to the first 20 seconds of the following clip of <em>Sintra</em> from Snarky Puppy’s incredible collaboration with the Metropole Orkest.

But an observant student may have noticed the conductor in the background (around the 2:29 mark) conducting in a double-time three, which means that the conductor is placing an <em>off-beat</em> where the listener is likely hearing beat 2 of their slow simple triple meter. If we move our starting point backward by only ten seconds, we hear the original groove of this section of the tune, which is the origin of the double-time simple triple meter that we saw the conductor using.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MBAJP-3ebDA?start=126" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>By starting at this new point, many listeners will switch to a faster (double-time) simple triple meter.

The melody happens mostly at the beat level, and the cellos have a constant arpeggio at the subdivision level. At the 1:20 mark, there is a slightly disconcerting two-beat transition, and then a new section starts that most listeners will hear as a continuation of the slow compound quadruple meter of the intro. This is reinforced by an ostinato in a contra-bass clarinet as well as the body language of the performers. When the trumpet and saxophone enter with a new melody at 1:32, we realize that this slow compound quadruple meter is the exact same feel and melody that we heard as a fast simple triple melody in the second clip.</p><p>The conclusion of this exercise should be that the listener’s perception of meter is not tied to what is on the page, only to a complex array of aural input. Therefore, we can discuss meter in an objective manner by looking at what is written, but a listener is not required to hear the meter similarly to an analysis or even in the way in which the composer intended.</p><p>First-inversion and third-inversion chords are used to make smoother, more melodic bass lines, but in doing so, we put tendency tones–and all of the accompanying expectations–into the bass. Even though this seems more restrictive, first- and third- inversion chords actually allow more freedom in part-writing because: - they remove the potential objectionable parallels that come from having the root in the bass. - the upper voices have one less tendency tone to distribute and resolve correctly.</p><h3 id="resolving-tendency-tones">Resolving tendency tones</h3><p>Use the voicing and voice-leading guidelines discussed in the previous topic to harmonize the following progressions as a four-part chorale.

Because the vi chord acts as a tonic function when part of a deceptive progression, we double the scale degree that works best for the standard tonic chord, <code>do</code> of the I chord, rather than the general part-writing doubling rule for root position chords in which you would prefer to double the root. This means that in the deceptive progression, it is correct to break standard doubling convention and double the chordal third of the vi chord. Now that we are looking at first inversion voice-leading, we have another <em>functional substitution</em> to discuss. - vii<sup>o</sup> is a dominant function, so therefore functions as V<sup>7</sup> chord without its root</p><p>Because of this, the vii<sup>o</sup> chord must follow different <em>doubling</em> rules in order to avoid poor voice-leading. With this in mind, try to harmonize the following progressions; first a simple I-V<sup>6/5</sup>-I progression, and then with an added root-position vii<sup>o</sup> chord. You will discover that: - the two chords have all but one pitch in common. - resolving a root-position vii<sup>o</sup> is extremely difficult and will require one voice to make consecutive jumps of a P5 to avoid issues due to tendency tone resolutions.**</p><p>{% capture ex2 %}X:2 T:Voicing a viio using functional substitution M:4/4 L:1/4 Q:1/4=70 K:C V:1 [cE] xx2|| [cE] xxx|] V:2 clef=bass [C,G,] [B,,] [C,2]|| [C,G,] [B,,] [B,,] [C,]|] w:C:I V6/5 I I viio V6/5 I{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“2” abc=ex2 %}</p><p>Because the root position vii<sup>o</sup> triad is so difficult, it is rarely used.

To this point, we have considered the circle-of-fifths as the voice-leading foundation for diatonic harmony. In this case, the ii chord would be the “primary” pre-dominant function, and in many ways, this is true. The IV chord, however, holds a special place in harmony because of its role as the <em>subdominant</em>–the opposite pole of the dominant–as well as the high frequency throughout history of the I-IV-V-I progression.</p><p>Generally speaking, root position ii chords and root position IV chords are equally strong and follow standard doubling conventions. When the ii chord is in first inversion, however, it can be voiced as if it is the functional substitution of a root-position IV chord meaning that a ii<sup>6</sup> chord often takes its doubling from a root-position IV chord. (In the same way that a vii<sup>o</sup> chord takes its doubling from a V<sup>7</sup> chord.) Try this on the following progressions.

We now add a new category of functions called <em>tertiary</em> functions–which we will discuss in detail in the next topic, Unit 11d–and our first type of tertiary function is the <em>passing chord</em>. (If you are wondering why we are skipping over secondary functions, we will cover those in Unit 14.) A <em>passing chord</em> is a chord that is inserted between two other chords to create stepwise motion within a voice–usually in the bass line. You can consider <em>passing</em> a function that removes a chord’s standard function (i.e. tonic, dominant, and predominant), and instead extends the function of the chords on either side.</p><p>Let’s see how this works by attempting an example that seemingly breaks all of our harmonic progressions norms. When you first look at the progression below, you should immediately notice that a V chord resolves to a IV chord–which does not follow our harmonic flowchart of primary functions. While this is generally true, there is something happening here that requires you to look at the bigger picture. Try to harmonize the following progression using your best voice-leading, and as you do so, pay particular attention to the motion within each voice. You will notice that there is no tenor voice in the first chord, so you may try multiple options to see if you can find a solution for a tenor voice that fulfills all guidelines thus far.</p><p>{% capture ex4 %}X:4 T:Passing chords M:4/4 L:1/4 Q:1/4=60 K:C V:1 [cE][d][c][d]| [c]4|] V:2 clef=bass [C,][B,,][A,,][G,,]| [C,]4|] w:C:I V6 IV6 V7 I{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“4” abc=ex4 %}</p><h4 id="conclusions-65">Conclusions</h4><p>In the example above, the melodic, stepwise motion of the bass line traps us into making some difficult harmonic choices. We want to end on a PAC, which means that as we extend the progression backward, we don’t have any choices that would follow our standard harmonic flowchart of primary functions. (Please refer to Unit 7a if you need a refresher on primary functions in diatonic harmony.) We can use a pre-dominant function on beat 3 to lead to our dominant function chord on beat 4, but there are no primary function harmonies that lead to a pre-dominant that also incorporate the leading tone of the bass line. (Of note, the I<sup>M7</sup> is not used in this style of composition; you are welcome to try it and you will notice that it doesn’t sound to out of place, but we would analyze this as two beats of a I chord with a passing tone (non-chord tone) on the second beat of the bass line.)</p><p>The solution is to use another dominant chord on beat 2. Even though we would not normally have a dominant harmony resolve to a IV chord, in this case, the IV chord is not functioning as a IV chord with its typical primary function as a pre-dominant chord. Instead, it has taken on a <em>tertiary function</em> as a <em>passing chord</em>. Look at the voice-leading within each voice of this completed example:</p><p>{% capture ex6 %}X:6 T:Passing chord extending dominant function M:4/4 L:1/4 Q:1/4=60 K:C V:1 [cE][dD][cF][dF]| [cE]4|] V:2 clef=bass [C,G,][B,,G,][A,,A,][G,,B,]| [C,C]4|] w:C:I V6 IV6 V7 I{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“6” abc=ex6 %}</p><p>If you were to ignore the fact that beat 3 forms a standard triad, you can assign each voice on beat 3 to a standard non-chord tone label, as if it were not part of a harmony. - The soprano voice is a neighbor tone between the two Cs. - The alto voice is an anticipation of the F on beat 4. - The tenor voice is a passing tone between beats 2 and 4. - And most importantly, the bass voice is a passing tone between beats 2 and 4. So even though a V chord does not usually resolve to a IV chord, in this particular case, it only <em>looks</em> as if it is resolving to a IV chord. In reality, each voice is simply moving through a non-chord tone…which happens to form a standard triad on beat 3. So instead of trying to label the IV chord as having a standard function, you would say that it’s function is extending the dominant function on either side of it.</p><p>So when this happens, we still want to acknowledge that the chord exists, but we also want to note that it is no longer a primary function. We will discuss the notation of of tertiary functions more in the next topic, but for now, label them using their standard Roman numeral and inversion figure, but put the Roman numeral inside of parentheses with a label of “pass” directly beneath it. Note that passing chords–meaning chords who create passing motion in one or more voices–act as if they are a group of non-chord tones. You may even think of them as “non-chord tone chords” if that helps. A listener will hear this progression as an extension of the dominant function, not as an alternating dominant/pre-dominant/dominant pattern. Any inversion of a chord can be classified as a passing chord as long as it creates stepwise motion in one or more voices–usually the bass voice–and it is common for many first- and third-inversion chords function this way.</p><p>You may also notice that we have an unusual doubling on the IV<sup>6</sup> chord, but once we discuss second inversion chords in the next unit, we will be able to update the guidelines for doubling chord tones to more closely reflect what exists in music.</p><h2 id="class-discussion-46">Class discussion</h2><p>There are a lot of counterpoint rules, but you can eliminate possible errors by priotizing things that those rules don’t pertain to: - Stepwise motion! There’s a lot of rules that have to do with usage of skips and leaps, and by focusing on stepwise motion you avoid these - Your counterpoint will <em>always</em> end with re in one voice and ti in the other. If you put yourself in a position to get to those notes that bar before the penultimate bar, the last two measures will write themselves - Focus on using imperfect consonances/sixths and thirds. These have less rules than perfect consonances - Be mindful of how you approach skips and leaps if you have to use them</p><h2 id="further-reading-24">Further reading</h2><h3 id="from-open-music-theory-23">From <em>Open Music Theory</em></h3><h4 id="embellishing-tones">Embellishing tones</h4><h5 id="passing-tone-pt-1">Passing Tone (PT)</h5><p><img src="images/embellishingTones/passingTone.png" /></p><p>A passing tone is a melodic embellishment (typically a non-chord tone) that occurs between two stable tones (typically chord tones), creating stepwise motion. The typical figure is <em>chord tone – passing tone – chord tone</em>, filling in a third (see example), but two adjacent passing tones can also be used to fill in the space between two chord tones a fourth apart. A passing tone can be either accented (occurring on a strong beat or strong part of the beat) or unaccented (weak beat or weak part of the beat).</p><h5 id="complete-neighbor-tone-nt">Complete Neighbor Tone (NT)</h5><p><img src="images/embellishingTones/neighborTone.png" /></p><p>Like the passing tone, a complete neighbor tone is a melodic embellishment that occurs between two stable tones (typically chord tones); however, a complete neighbor tone will occur between two instances of the same stable tone. Also like the passing tone, movement from the stable tone to the neighbor tone and back will always be by step. A complete neighbor can be either accented or unaccented, but unaccented is more common.</p><h5 id="double-neighbor-figure-dn">Double Neighbor Figure (DN)</h5><p><img src="/images/embellishingTones/doubleNeighbor.png" /></p><p>Like the complete neighbor figure, the double neighbor figure begins and ends on the <em>same</em> stable tone (typically a chord tone). Between those two instances of the stable tone are two embellishing tones — one a step above and the other a step below the stable tone being embellished. Though individually we may consider each of the two embellishing tones to be incomplete neighbors (below), working together in the double-neighbor figure they balance each other out and create a contiguous whole, with the overall stability of a complete neighbor. A double neighbor figure is typically unaccented.</p><h5 id="incomplete-neighbor-tone-int-1">Incomplete Neighbor Tone (INT)</h5><p><img src="images/embellishingTones/INT.png" /></p><p>The incomplete neighbor tone is an unaccented embellishing tone that is approached by leap and proceeds by step to an accented stable tone (typically a chord tone). Broadly speaking an incomplete neighbor tone is any embellishing tone a step away from a stable tone that proceeds or follows it (and is connected on the other side by leap), but other kinds of incomplete neighbor tones have special names and roles that follow below.</p><h5 id="appoggiatura-app">Appoggiatura (APP)</h5><p><img src="images/embellishingTones/appoggiatura.png" /></p><p>An appoggiatura is a kind of incomplete neighbor tone that is accented, approached by leap (usually up), and followed by step (usually down, but always in the opposite direction of the preceding leap) to a more stable tone (typically a chord tone).</p><h5 id="escape-tone-esc">Escape Tone (ESC)</h5><p><img src="images/embellishingTones/escapeTone.png" /></p><p>An escape tone, or <em>echappée</em>, is a kind of incomplete neighbor tone that is unaccented, preceded by step (usually up) from a chord tone, and followed by leap (usually down, but always in the opposite direction of the preceding step).</p><h5 id="anticipation-ant">Anticipation (ANT)</h5><p><img src="images/embellishingTones/anticipation.png" /></p><p>An anticipation is essentially an otherwise stable tone that comes too early. An anticipation is typically a non-chord tone that will occur immediately before a change of harmony, and it will be followed on that change of harmony by the same note, now a chord tone of the new harmony. It is typically found at the ends of phrases and larger formal units.</p><h5 id="syncopation-syn">Syncopation (SYN)</h5><p><img src="/images/embellishingTones/syncopatedNote.png" /></p><p><a href="http://openmusictheory.com/syncopation.html">Syncopation</a> occurs when a rhythmic pattern that typically occurs on strong beats or strong parts of the beat occurs instead on weak beats or weak parts of the beat. Like the anticipation, the syncopated note is an early arrival — it tends to belong to the chord on the following beat. Unlike the anticipation, the syncopation is tied into a note in that chord; it is not rearticulated. Rather than anticipating a note in the chord that follows, a syncopation is simply an early arrival.</p><h5 id="suspension-sus-1">Suspension (SUS)</h5><p><img src="images/embellishingTones/suspension.png" /></p><p>A suspension is formed of three critical parts: the <em>preparation</em> (accented or unaccented), the <em>suspension</em> itself (accented), and the <em>resolution</em> (unaccented). The preparation is a chord tone (consonance). The suspension is <em>the same note</em> as the preparation and occurs simultaneous with a change of harmony. The suspension then proceeds down by step to the resolution, which occurs over the same harmony as the suspension. The suspension is in many respects the opposite of the syncopation: if the anticipation is an early arrival of a tone belonging to the following chord, a suspension is a lingering of a chord tone belonging to the previous chord that forces the late arrival of the new chord’s chord tone. However, in composition and improvisation, the suspension must be treated with a great deal more care than the syncopation. The most common suspensions (and their resolutions) in upper voices form the following intervallic patterns against the bass: 9–8, 7–6, 4–3. (With the exception of 9–8, the pitch class of the resolution tone should never sound in another voice simultaneous with the suspended tone.) Instead of <em>SUS</em>, it is more typical to notate the intervallic pattern in the thoroughbass figures.</p><h5 id="retardation-ret">Retardation (RET)</h5><p><img src="images/embellishingTones/retardation.png" /></p><p>A retardation is essentially an upward-resolving suspension. It is almost always reserved for the final chord of a large formal division (or a movement), and it frequently appears simultaneously with a suspension (as seen in the example). Instead of <em>RET</em>, it is preferable to notate the intervallic pattern in the thoroughbass figures.</p><h4 id="second-species-counterpoint-1">Second species counterpoint</h4><h3 id="the-counterpoint-line-1">The counterpoint line</h3><p>As in first species, the counterpoint line should be singable, have a good shape, with a single climax and primarily stepwise motion (with some small leaps and an occasional large leap for variety). However, because a first-species counterpoint had so few notes, in order to maintain smoothness in other aspects of the exercise, the melody frequently employed small leaps. In second species, the increase in notes and the added freedom involving the use of dissonance makes it easier to move by step without causing other musical problems. Thus, a second-species counterpoint is even <em>more dominated by stepwise motion</em> than in first species.</p><p>If the counterpoint must leap, take advantage of the metrical arrangement to diminish the attention drawn to the leap: leap from strong beat to weak beat (within the bar) rather than from weak beat to strong beat (across the barline) when possible.</p><p>Also, because there are more notes in a second species line, there should usually be one or two <em>secondary climaxes</em>—notes lower than the overall climax that serve as “local” climaxes for portions of the line. This will help the integrity of the line, by ensuring it has a coherent shape and does not simply wander around.</p><h4 id="beginning-a-second-species-counterpoint">Beginning a second-species counterpoint</h4><p>As in first species, begin a second-species counterpoint above the cantus firmus with <em>do</em> or <em>sol</em>. Begin a second-species counterpoint below the cantus firmus with <em>do</em>. Unisons are permitted for the first and last dyads of the exercise.</p><p>A second-species line can begin with two half notes in the first bar, or a half rest followed by a half note. Beginning with a half rest establishes the rhythmic profile more readily, making it easier for the listener to parse, so it is often preferable. It is also easier to compose. Regardless of rhythm, the first pitch in the counterpoint should follow the intervallic rules above.</p><h4 id="ending-a-second-species-counterpoint">Ending a second-species counterpoint</h4><p>The final pitch of the counterpoint should be <em>do</em>, as in first species.</p><p>The penultimate note of the counterpoint should be <em>ti</em> if the cantus is <em>re</em>, and <em>re</em> if the cantus is <em>ti</em>, as in first species.</p><p>The penultimate bar of the counterpoint can either be a <em>whole note</em> (making the last two bars identical to first species), or two half notes. Which option you use will depend on how you are approaching the final bar. (This is simply a historical convention, not a musical necessity. But the added degree of freedom makes it easier to move into the final arrival smoothly without adding too many complicating factors.)</p><h4 id="strong-beats">Strong beats</h4><p><em>Because the inclusion of dissonance in a musical texture creates new musical problems that need to be addressed, second species introduces dissonance in a very limited way. This is not a musical necessity, and it’s not the only way to address dissonance, but it helps by introducing a small number of new musical difficulties in each species.</em></p><p>Strong beats (downbeats) in second species are <em>always consonant</em>. As in first species, prefer imperfect consonances (thirds and sixths) to perfect consonances (fifths and octaves), and avoid unisons.</p><p>Because motion across bar lines (from weak beat to strong beat) involves the same kind of voice motion as first species (two voices moving simultaneously), follow the same principles as first species counterpoint. For instance, if a weak beat is a perfect fifth, the following downbeat must not also be a perfect fifth.</p><p>Likewise progressions from downbeat to downbeat must follow principles of first-species counterpoint. The following are some examples, but not an exhaustive list:</p><ul><li>Do not begin two consecutive bars with the same perfect interval.<br />
</li><li>Do not outline a dissonant melodic interval between consecutive downbeats. (Exception: if the counterpoint leaps an octave from the strong beat to the weak beat, the leap should be followed by step in the opposite direction making a seventh with the preceding downbeat. This is okay, since it is the result of smooth voice motion.)<br />
</li><li>Do not begin more than three bars in a row with the same imperfect consonance.</li></ul><p><em>Hidden</em> or <em>direct fifths/octaves</em> between successive downbeats are fine, as the effect is weak, and the intervening note in the counterpoint diminishes that effect.</p><h4 id="weak-beats">Weak beats</h4><p>Since harmonic dissonances can appear on weak beats, a mixture of consonant and dissonant intervals on weak beats is the best way to promote variety.</p><p>Unisons were problematic in first species because they diminished the independence of the lines. However, when they occur on the weak beats of second species and are the result of otherwise smooth voice-leading, the rhythmic difference in line is sufficient to maintain that independence. Thus, unisons are permitted on weak beats when necessary to make good counterpoint between the lines.</p><p>Any weak-beat dissonance must follow the pattern of the <em>dissonant passing tone</em>, explained below. Also explained below are a number of standard patterns for consonant weak beats. Chances are high that if your weak beats do not fit into one of the following patterns, there is a problem with the counterpoint, so use them as a guide both for composing the counterpoint, and for evaluating it.</p><h4 id="weak-beat-patterns">Weak beat patterns</h4><p>The following patterns (whose terms are either standard or taken from Salzer &amp; Schachter’s <em>Counterpoint in Composition</em>) should guide your use of weak-beat notes in a second-species counterpoint line. A good general practice is to start with a downbeat note, then choose the following downbeat note, and finally choose a pattern below that will allow you to fill in the space between downbeats well.</p><p>Most of these are used as examples in the demonstration video at the bottom of the page.</p><h5 id="dissonant-weak-beats">Dissonant weak beats</h5><p><em>All dissonant weak beats in second species are dissonant passing tones</em>, so called because the counterpoint line passes from one consonant downbeat to another consonant downbeat by stepwise motion. The melodic interval from downbeat to downbeat in the counterpoint will always be a third, and the passing tone will come in the middle in order to fill that third with passing motion.</p><p>Since all dissonances in second species are passing tones, you will never leap into or out of a dissonant tone, nor will you change directions on a dissonant tone, nor will any dissonances occur on a downbeat.</p><iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/music/ef1cff1ee3" width="100%" height="300" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><br/></p><h5 id="consonant-weak-beats">Consonant weak beats</h5><p>A <em>consonant passing tone</em> outlines a third from downbeat to downbeat, and has the same pattern as the dissonant passing tone, except that all three tones (downbeat, passing tone, downbeat) are consonant with the cantus.

However, instead of filling it in with stepwise motion, the counterpoint leaps a fourth and then steps in the opposite direction. It is called a substitution because it can substitute for a passing tone in a line that needs an extra leap or change of direction to provide variety. Like the consonant passing tone, all three notes in the counterpoint must be consonant with the cantus.</p><iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/music/f258be56b6" width="100%" height="300" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><br/></p><p>A <em>skipped passing tone</em> outlines a fourth from downbeat to downbeat.

The large, consonant melodic interval between downbeats is divided into two smaller consonant leaps. A melodic fifth between downbeats would be divided into two thirds. A melodic sixth between downbeats would be divided into a third and a fourth, or a fourth and a third. Not only must all three <em>melodic</em> intervals be consonant (both note-to-note intervals and the downbeat-to-downbeat interval), but each note in the counterpoint must be consonant with the cantus.</p><iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/music/a79b68de03" width="100%" height="300" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><br/></p><p>A <em>change of register</em> occurs when a large, consonant leap (P5, sixth, or octave) from strong beat to weak beat is followed by a step in the opposite direction. It is used to achieve melodic variety after a long stretch of stepwise motion, to avoid parallels or other problems, or to get out of the way of the cantus to maintain independence. It should be used infrequently. And as always, each note must be consonant with the cantus.</p><iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/music/827ad0b4a2" width="100%" height="300" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><br/></p><p>A <em>delay of melodic progression</em> outlines a step from downbeat to downbeat. It involves a leap of a third from strong beat to weak beat, followed by a step in the opposite direction into the following downbeat. It is called a “delay” because it is used to embellish what otherwise is a slower first-species progression (motion by step from downbeat to downbeat).</p><iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/music/5764fe4a4b" width="100%" height="300" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><br/></p><p>A <em>consonant neighbor tone</em> occurs when the counterpoint moves by step from downbeat to weak beat, and then returns to the original pitch on the following downbeat.

Since a dyad is defined by the interval between the two pitches, dyads are often simply called intervals.</p><p>Thus, the term <em>interval</em> regularly refers both to the distance between two pitches on a scale and to a dyad whose pitches are separated by that distance.</p><h4 id="diatonic-intervals">Diatonic intervals</h4><p>More commonly for tonal music, we are interested in the number of steps on the diatonic (major or minor) scale. This is a bit tricky—not because it’s difficult, but because it’s counter-intuitive. Unfortunately, the system is too old and well engrained to change it now! But once you get past the initial strangeness, diatonic intervals are manageable.</p><p>When identifying a diatonic interval, begin with the <em>letter names only</em>. That is, treat C, C-sharp, and C-flat all as <em>C</em> for the time being. Next, count the number of steps (different letters) between the two pitches in question, <em>including both pitches in your count</em>. This gives you the <em>generic interval</em>.</p><p>For example, from C4 to E4, counting both C and E, there are three diatonic steps (three letter names): C, D, E. Thus, the generic interval for C4–E4 is a <em>third</em>. The same is true for any C to any E: C#4 to E4, Cb4 to E#4, etc. They are all diatonic thirds.</p><figure><img src="images/intervals/thirds.png" alt="Three kinds of generic thirds." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Three kinds of generic thirds.</figcaption></figure><p>Often more specificity is needed than generic intervals can provide.

A third that encompasses four semitones is a <em>major third</em> (M3). Note that both generic interval and chromatic interval are necessary to find the specific interval, since there are multiple specific diatonic intervals for each generic interval and for each chromatic interval.</p><p>Note that some generic intervals can be augmented, perfect, or diminished, and other intervals can be augmented, major, minor, or diminished. There is no generic interval that can be both major/minor and perfect; if it can be major or minor, it cannot be perfect, and if it can be perfect, it cannot be major or minor. An augmented version of an interval is always one semitone wider than major or perfect; diminished is always one semitone smaller than minor or perfect.</p><p>Solfège can also help to determine the specific interval. Each pair of solfège syllables will have the same interval, no matter what the key, as long as it is clear which syllable is the lower pitch and which is the upper pitch. Memorizing the intervals between solfège pairs can help speed along your analysis of dyads as they appear in music. For example, knowing that <em>do</em>–<em>mi</em>, <em>fa</em>–<em>la</em>, and <em>sol</em>–<em>ti</em> are always major thirds and knowing that <em>re</em>–<em>fa</em>, <em>mi</em>–<em>sol</em>, <em>la</em>–<em>do</em>, and <em>ti</em>–<em>re</em> are always minor thirds will allow for faster analysis of dyads in major keys.</p><h4 id="chromatic-intervals">Chromatic intervals</h4><p>The simplest way to measure intervals, particularly at the keyboard, is to count the number of half-steps, or <em>semitones</em>, between two pitches. To determine the chromatic interval between C4 and E4, for example, start at C4 and ascend the chromatic scale to E4, counting steps along the way: C#4, D4, D#4, E4. E4 is four semitones higher than C4. Chromatic intervals are notated with a lower-case <strong>i</strong> followed by an Arabic numeral for the number of semitones. C4–E4 is four semitones, or <strong>i4</strong>.</p><figure><img src="images/intervals/C4E4.png" alt="Chromatic steps from C4 to E4." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Chromatic steps from C4 to E4.</figcaption></figure><h4 id="compound-intervals">Compound intervals</h4><p>The intervals discussed above, from unison to octave, are called <em>simple intervals</em>. Any interval larger than an octave is considered a <em>compound interval</em>. Take the interval C4 to E5. The generic interval is a tenth. However, it functions the same as C4 to E4 in almost all musical circumstances. Thus, the tenth C4–E5 is also called a <em>compound third</em>. A compound interval takes the same quality as the corresponding simple interval. If C4–E4 is a major third, then C4–E5 is a major tenth.</p><figure><img src="images/intervals/compound.png" alt="Simple and compound major thirds." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Simple and compound major thirds.</figcaption></figure><h4 id="interval-inversion">Interval inversion</h4><p>In addition to C4–E4 and C4–E5, E4–C5 also shares a similar sound and musical function. In fact, any dyad that keeps the same two pitch classes but changes register will have a similar sound and function. However, the fact that E4–C5 has E as its lowest pitch instead of C means that it has a different generic interval: E4–C5 is a sixth, not a third. Because of that difference, it will also play a different musical function in some circumstances. However, there is no escaping the relationship.</p><p>Dyads formed by the same two pitch classes, but with different pitch classes on bottom and on top, are said to be <em>inversions</em> of each other, because the pitch classes are <em>inverted</em>. Likewise, the intervals marked off by those inverted dyads are said to be <em>inversions</em> of each other.</p><p>Again, take C4–E4 (major third) and E4–C5 (minor sixth). These two dyads have the same two pitch classes, but one has C on bottom and E on top, while the other has E on bottom and C on top. Thus, they are inversions of each other.</p><figure><img src="images/intervals/inversion.png" alt="Inversion relationship: major third and minor sixth." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Inversion relationship: major third and minor sixth.</figcaption></figure><p>Three relationships exhibited by these two dyads hold for all interval inversions.</p><p>First, the chromatic intervals add up to 12. (C4–E4 = i4; E4–C5 = i8; i4 + i8 = i12) This is because the two intervals add up to an octave (with an overlap on E4).</p><p>Second, <em>the two generic interval values add up to nine</em> (a third plus a sixth, or 3 + 6). This is because the two intervals add up to an octave (8), and one of the notes is counted twice when you add them together. (Remember the counterintuitive way of counting off diatonic intervals, where the number includes the starting and ending pitches, and when combining inverted intervals, there is always one note that gets counted twice—in this case, E4.)</p><p>Lastly, the major interval inverts into a minor, and vice versa. This always holds for interval inversion. Likewise, an augmented interval’s inversion is always diminished, and vice versa. A perfect interval’s inversion is always perfect.</p><blockquote><p>major ↔︎ minor<br />
augmented ↔︎ diminished<br />
perfect ↔︎ perfect</p></blockquote><p>Interval inversion may seem confusing and esoteric now, but it will be an incredibly important concept for the study of voice-leading and the study of harmony.</p><h4 id="methods-for-learning-intervals">Methods for learning intervals</h4><p>Ultimately, <a href="intervals.html">intervals</a> need to be committed to memory, both aurally and visually. There are, however, a few tricks to learning this quickly. One such trick is the so-called <em>white-key method</em>.</p><h5 id="white-key-method">White-Key Method</h5><p>The <em>white-key method</em> requires you to memorize all of the intervals found between the white keys on the piano (or simply all of the intervals in the key of C major). Once you’ve learned these, any interval can be calculated as an alteration of a white-key interval. For example, we can figure out the interval D4-F#4 if we know that the interval D4-F4 is a minor third, and this interval has been made one semitone larger: a major third.</p><p>Conveniently, there is a lot of repetition of interval size and quality among white-key intervals. Memorize the most frequent type, and the exceptions.</p><p>All of the seconds are <em>major</em> except for two: E-F, and B-C, which are <em>minor</em>.</p><p><img src="images/intervals/wnm-seconds.png"></p><p>All of the thirds are <em>minor</em> except for three: C-E, F-A, and G-B, which are <em>major</em>.</p><p><img src="images/intervals/wnm-thirds.png"></p><p>All of the fourths are <em>perfect</em> except for one: F-B, which is <em>augmented</em>.</p><p><img src="images/intervals/wnm-fourths.png"></p><p>Believe it or not, you now know <em>all</em> of the white-key intervals, as long as you understand the concept of <em>interval inversion</em>. For example, if you know that all seconds are major except for E-F and B-C (which are minor), then you know that all <em>sevenths</em> are minor except for F-E and C-B (which are major).</p><p><img src="images/intervals/wnm-sevenths.png"></p><p>Once you’ve mastered the white-key intervals, you can figure out any other interval by adjusting the size accordingly.</p><h4 id="melodic-and-harmonic-intervals">Melodic and harmonic intervals</h4><p>The last distinction between interval types to note is <em>melodic</em> v. <em>harmonic</em> intervals. This distinction is simple. If the two pitches of a dyad sound at the same time (a two-note chord), the interval between them is a <em>harmonic interval</em>. If the two pitches in question are sounded back-to-back (as in a melody), the interval between them is a <em>melodic interval</em>. This distinction is important in voice-leading, where different intervals are preferred or forbidden in harmonic contexts than in melodic contexts. The difference is also important for listening, as hearing melodic and harmonic intervals of the same quality requires different techniques.</p><h4 id="consonance-and-dissonance">Consonance and dissonance</h4><p>Intervals are categorized as <em>consonant</em> or <em>dissonant</em> based on their sound (how stable, sweet, or harsh they sound), how easy they are to sing, and how they best function in a passage (beginning, middle, end; between certain other intervals; etc.). Different standards apply to melody and harmony. The following categories will be essential for your work in strict voice-leading, and they will be a helpful guide for free composition and arranging work, as well.</p><p><strong>Melodic consonance and dissonance</strong></p><p>The following <em>melodic</em> intervals are <em>consonant</em>, and can be used in strict voice-leading both for successive pitches and as boundaries of stepwise progressions in a single direction:</p><ul><li>All perfect intervals (P4, P5, P8)<br />

How we’re “supposed” to interpret leadsheet notation can change depending on the composer.

Most pop/rock songs have a mixture of syncopated and “straight” rhythms. The syncopated rhythms are usually easy to sing, since they often match speech better than straight rhythms. However, they are more difficult than straight rhythms to sight-sing, dictate, or transcribe.</p><h3 id="straight-syncopations">Straight syncopations</h3><p>In contemporary pop/rock music, syncopation typically involves taking a series of notes of equal durations, cutting the duration of the first note in half, and shifting the rest early by that half duration.</p><p>For example, a series of four quarter notes, all sounding on the beat, can be transformed in this way by making the first note into an eighth note, and sounding each successive quarter note on eighth note early—all on the <em>offbeats</em>.</p><p>This process can occur on any metrical level. If the duration of the series of “straight” notes is two beats, they will be syncopated by changing the first note to a single beat and shifting each other note early by a beat. If the duration of the straight notes, like the figure above, is a beat, they will be syncopated by a division (one half beat in simple meter). If the straight notes are each divisions, they will be syncopated by shifting each note by a subdivision. The unit of syncopation (the duration of the first note, and the amount of shift applied to the following notes) is always half of the duration of the straight notes. All of these syncopations are realtively common in contemporary pop/rock music.</p><p>As a convention, when we take a series of notes that each have a duration of one beat and shift them early by half of a beat, we will call that <em>beat-level syncopation</em>. When we take a series of notes that each have a duration of one division and shift them early by a subdivision, we will call that <em>division-level syncopation</em>.</p><p><em>Beat-level syncopation.</em><br />
<a href="images/syncopation/quarterToEighth.png"><img src="images/syncopation/quarterToEighth.png" /></a></p><p><em>Division-level syncopation.</em><br />
<a href="images/syncopation/eighthToSixteenth.png"><img src="images/syncopation/eighthToSixteenth.png" /></a></p><p>(Note the use of ties to make each beat clear. Always do this in order to make it easy to read.)</p><h3 id="transcribing-straight-syncopations">Transcribing straight syncopations</h3><p>Straight syncopated rhythms are easily identified by the frequently occuring off-beat rhythms. For example, if you conduct or tap the counting pulse while listening to a song, several notes in a row that are articulated between your taps or conducted beats, with no notes articulated simultaneously with the counting pulse, indicate syncopation.</p><p>Once you identify a syncopated passage—which may only involve two or three notes—figure out on what metrical level the syncopation occurs. For example, in simple meter, if no notes are articulated directly on the counting pulse beats and one note is articulated in between each beat, the syncopation is occuring at the beat level. If no notes are articulated directly on the counting pulse beats and <em>two notes</em> are articulated in between each beat, listen to the passage again while tapping the <em>division</em>. If no notes are articulated directly on the division taps and one note is articulated in between each tap, the syncopation is occuring at the division level.</p><p>Once you have determined the metrical level on which the syncopation occurs, determine the durational value of the shift. If the syncopation occurs on the beat level (one note sounding between each counting pulse beat), the value of syncopation is a division: each beat-length note has been shifted one division early. If the syncopation occurs on the division level, the value of syncopation is a subdivision: each division-length note has been shifted one subdivision early.</p><p>Lastly, determine how the syncopated pattern begins. Does the offbeat pattern simply begin offbeat? Or does the pattern begin with two quick notes back-to-back as above—one short note on the beat followed by the first of the longer syncopated notes?</p><p>Once you have determinted the level of syncopation, the duration of the shift, and whether or not the pattern begins with a truncated onbeat note, the rhythmic pattern should be easy to notate. If, however, you are still having difficulty, try using the lyric syllables and the stress patterns of the lyrics to help you keep track of the individual notes and which ones are on/offbeat. Writing lyrics down before notating the rhythm can be a big help.</p><h3 id="fake-triplets">Fake triplets</h3><p>Another common rhythmic pattern in pop/rock is to divide a beat (or two beats) into three almost-equal groups.

This looks weird on paper and sucks to sight read, but for the purposes of harmonic analysis we write it this way.</p><p><strong>Consecutive secondary dominant chords</strong> - It’s that fancy thirds to sevenths through static motion thing again!! - Sequences of consecutive secondary dominants can work well if you know what you’re doing! Don’t try and do this with secondary leading tone chords though, that can get really messy really quickly because voice leading for one on its own is already a nightmare. When in doubt, remember to keep it simple</p><p><strong>Secondary dominants and their related chords</strong> - V/V and ii - V/ii and vi - V/vi and iii - For all of these, you identify them by listening to/noting the quality of the chord. Secondary dominants are always going to be major, while all their counterparts listed above (aka normalsauce variants) will be minor</p><p><strong>Deceptive resolutions of secondary dominant functions</strong> - V7/vi should resolve to vi, but we have it going to IV instead which is weird - It’s a deceptive progression!! V7/vi - IV is V - VI in C’s relative minor, A minor - To ID this correctly, be looking for a secondary dominant chord that… - Doesn’t go where it’s supposed to - Is followed by a root position chord WITH root movement up by step</p><h2 id="class-discussion-55">Class discussion</h2><p><strong>Secondary function pivot chord</strong> - What do we do when there is no good pivot chord? Like both of them are <em>really</em> ugly? - We pivot on a secondary function chord, which isn’t ideal but, hey, it works. In our Bach example, we debated modulating on one chord vs. the other: the F chord, or the B0/D. Ultimately, 99% of the time pivoting on the B0/D is gonna be the move: we end up with vii06/ii in Bb and vii06 in the new key, C minor. This is a more sudden, dramatic sound than a common chord pivot modulation - Secondary function pivot chords are obviously possible, but if you can use a common chord pivot modulation (where both IDs are diatonic) use that instead! It’s better. - Again, you will usually see pivot modulations in the middle of a phrase. This is because they have to have a functional progression on both sides of the pivot.</p><p><strong>Direct modulation/Phrase modulation</strong> - Pretty common in Broadway and country music. It’s that thing where you repeat everything you just did but up a step or a up a third! - The signal for this modulation is, to nobody’s surprise, the end of a phrase. This requires a cadence: phrases are defined by cadences, so you <em>have</em> to have a cadence right before a phrase modulation. - After this they can modulate pretty much wherever, but a lot of times you get a modulation to the iii/III because it’s a really dramatic sound, since I and iii are so far away from each other - This type of modulation is not labeled with a bracket. Instead, you designate the new key in the same line as the old one and continue as normal</p><p><strong>Common tone modulation</strong> - Requires a bracket to label, but instead of the chord you label the common tones used to move between keys. We label the scale degrees, putting the scale degree in the old key above the bracket while we put the new one below (make sure to use ^ to designate the numbers as scale degrees!!) - Ex: in the Schubert excerpt we looked at in class, we modulate in the third to last measure, using the C# in the melody and the piano as our common tone. We’re moving from D minor to F# major, so we would put “^7” in the upper part of the bracket, then “F#: ^5” in the lower part. Remember that even though you’re labeling pitches instead of chords with this type of modulation, you still designate the new key in the same way as with a pivot modulation.</p><h2 id="class-discussion-56">Class discussion</h2><p>Prime form is useful for making pitch class sets easy to compare with other pitch class sets.</p><p>Prime form is also another way we can say that pitch class sets are related.

(0,4,7) major triad. Invert (0,4,7) to (0,8,5) minor triad. Normal form for (0,8,5) is [5,8,0].

Take the normal form and set it on zero: [0,1,5,7].

NOW you compare the two normal forms on zero. - [0,1,5,7] and [0,2,6,7] - first you find the smallest interval between the first and 4th intergers (in this case it is the same). - then you check the interval between the first and 3rd intergers (in this case the first option has a smaller interval).</p><p><strong>Our prime form is (0157).</strong></p><h2 id="further-reading-29">Further reading</h2><h3 id="from-open-music-theory-28">From <em>Open Music Theory</em></h3><h4 id="set-class-relationships">Set class relationships</h4><p>Lots of concepts in pitch-class set theory are best viewed along a sliding scale of “concreteness” or “abstractness.” A concept like <em>pitch</em>, for example, is very concrete, while <em>pitch class</em> is somewhat more abstract. We can perform a pitch, but we can’t really perform a pitch class. We’ve seen similar examples in the intervallic realm. Ordered pitch intervals are associated with a very specific sound (e.g., +15); unordered pitch-class intervals (e.g., interval class 1) are less vivid or real. A basic concept in pitch-class set theory is that these levels of concreteness and abstractness encompass not only pitch and interval, but groups of pitch classes as well. These groups of pitch classes are called <em>pitch-class sets</em>.</p><p>We’ve already seen sets of pitch-classes, though we haven’t really been calling them that. When we extract a group of notes from a passage of music and put them in “[normal order][1],” that group of notes is a pitch-class set. As we’ve seen in class, one very interesting way of looking at a lot of post-tonal music is by studying the [transpositional][2] and [inversional][3] relationships between pitch-class sets. In the short example below (from Bartók’s “Subject and Reflection”) you’ll notice that the right hand of the two passages is <em>T5</em>-related, as is the left-hand. Within each passage, the right and left hands are _T8I _and <em>T6I</em> related, respectively.</p><p><a href="/images/postTonal/subjecdtAndReflection.png"><img src="/images/postTonal/subjecdtAndReflection.png" /></a></p><p><em>In order for a pitch-class set to be transpositionally or inversionally related to some other pitch class set, they must share the same collection of intervals</em>. This is most easily grasped by remembering that all major and minor triads have the same interval content (M3, m3, and P5). Major triads are transpositionally related to one another, while major and minor triads are inversionally related to one another. The same observation applies in Bartók’s “Subject and Reflection.” The four pitch-class sets in those two passages all have the same intervallic content and that’s why we can label transpositional and inversional relationships between them.</p><p>All pitch-class sets that are transpositionally and inversionally related belong to the same <em>set class</em>, and they are represented by the same <em>prime form</em>. We follow a simple process to put a pitch-class set in prime form:</p><ol type="1"><li>Put the pitch-class set in normal order.</li><li>Transpose it so that the first pitch class is 0.</li><li>Invert the results from step 2 (any inversion will work) and put the result in normal order.</li><li>Transpose it so that the first pitch class is 0.</li><li>Compare the results of steps (2) and (4). Prime form is the most compact version.</li></ol><p>The example below walks demonstrates using the motive from Bartók’s “Subject and Reflection.”</p><p><a href="/images/postTonal/primeForm.png"><img src="/images/postTonal/primeForm.png" /></a></p><h4 id="prime-form-2">Prime form</h4><p><em>Analytically</em>, the concept of set class is useful because it can show coherence in a composition. Bartók’s “[Subject and Reflection][1],” for example, uses the (02357) set class nearly exclusively—though it appears in many transpositions and inversions.</p><p><em>Theoretically</em>, the concept is useful because it provides a prism through which we can begin to study the <em>possibilities</em> provided to us by the twelve pitch-class universe. For almost 500 years, composers mostly used only a small subset of those possibilities (triads, seventh chords, and so forth). Set class lists reveals all of the other possibilities. They also give us hints as to why tonal composers used only a small portion of them and suggest entire worlds organized through other means. Fortunately for us, we don’t need to create such a list because many others have! A particularly good list is found [here][2], and I’ll give you another to keep in class.</p><p>Most of these set-class lists are organized similarly. Set classes that have the same number of notes in them (we say that they have the same “cardinality”) are grouped together: trichords (three-note pitch-class sets) sit together, as do nonachords (nine-note pitch-class sets), and so on.</p><p><a href="/images/postTonal/trichordsAndNonachords.png"><img src="/images/postTonal/trichordsAndNonachords.png" /></a></p><p>Prime form for each set class is show in parenthesis. The “Forte Number” (3-1, 9-1, etc.), often adjacent to the prime form, was given to each set class by the famous music theorist [Allen Forte][4], who was one of the first to describe the set class list.</p><h4 id="interval-class-vector">Interval Class Vector</h4><p>The interval class vector next to each set class’s prime form is particularly valuable. Think of it as a numeric representation of the “intervallic flavor” of each set class. IC vectors have six places &lt;_ _ _ _ _ _&gt; that are placeholders for interval classes 1–6. If a set class has a single interval class 1, it will have the digit 1 in the interval class vectors first placeholder. The IC vector &lt;001110&gt;, for example describes a trichord with 1 interval class 3, 1 interval class 4, and 1 interval class 5; that is, the major or minor triad, set class (037)!</p><h2 id="class-discussion-57">Class Discussion</h2><p><strong>First- and third-inversion chords in circle-of-fifths progressions</strong> - I - V6 - I - Melody: C D C.

Keeping it simple with G G G instead takes care of that - I V4/2 - I6 - Third inversion chords in this type of progression will always move to a first inversion chord because chordal sevenths resolve down to the third of the next chord</p><p><strong>Voicing a viio using functional substitution</strong> - Can’t double the root of a viio because it’s a tendency tone - The fifth is acting as the chordal seventh and follows the same resolution rules. Ex: in C, viio is B diminished. The fifth of the chord, F, will resolve down by step to E in I - Frustrated sevenths are not a thing. We can only have a frustrated leading tone - Don’t try and do viio in root position. As demonstrated in class, it doesn’t really work–we tried multiple inner voicings and all of them had a bunch of errors - I - viio - V6/5 - I - This is the one time you can double the fifth in a root position viio because it will result in a doubled root for V6/5, but honestly…it’s better to try and avoid them whenever possible</p><p><strong>Using functional substitutions for pre-dominants</strong> - 1: I - IV - V - I - For the IV, we have to take out the D. - 2: I - ii6 - V - I - We have to take out the C because ii is no longer a IV. t - To avoid this, double the third in ii6! ii and IV, as explained before, are similar in the same way as V and viio. ii6 can follow the same doubling rules as IV–its third is IV’s root, which we saw in #1 - 3: I - ii6/5 - V - I - Voicing for ii6/5, SATB: C D A (F). - Essentially: this is a rare thing, much like a frustrated leading tone, but it’s still good to know about for the purposes of analysis. This one also happens a lot, so it’s especially good to know about in advance</p><p><strong>Function</strong> - Primary: tonic, dominant, predominant. When we assign these to chords in a progression, we’re saying they fill a certain slot - Secondary: chords that borrow the functions of primary chords - Tertiary: using a chord in a way that has nothing to do with primary or secondary function. There are four kinds, but today we’re only talking about passing chords</p><p><strong>Passing chords</strong> - Creates passing motion. If you identify a chord as “passing,” you’re saying it has no primary function. Instead, we’re using it for smooth voice leading. To ID these chords, you put the Roman numeral in parentheses and write “passing” underneath it - Like other tertiary functions, these extend the primary functions on either side of them. If you insert a passing chord between two dominant function chords, you’ve simply lengthened the dominant section - V6 - IV6 - V. We made the IV6 a vi and V6 to vi is good, but vi to V is not…. so we label it a passing chord. - There’s no good option for this one, really…each one has its own errors, whether actual or just “not ideal,” so it’s a matter of picking the one that is the least bad</p><p>For many people, the terms <em>tone row</em> and <em>matrix</em> are synonymous with post-tonal theory. Luckily, your basic understanding of set theory comprehending tone rows fairly simple.</p><h3 id="starting-small">Starting small</h3><p>Let’s use set classes as a way to build up to understanding tone rows. To do this, start by writing out each unique, normal-form pc set represented in the set class of (013). Use your ability to transpose and invert that pc set to find them quickly. You can also think of this as listing every pc set represented by a single prime form.</p><h4 id="conclusion-23">Conclusion</h4><p>Because of your study of prime form, you probably realized that there are twenty-four possibilities. Because each of the pc sets will be in normal form, we know that there is only <em>one</em> pc set for each possible starting pitch. We can represent these using transposition notation. - T<sub>0</sub>[0,1,3] = [0,1,3] - T<sub>1</sub>[0,1,3] = [1,2,4] - T<sub>2</sub>[0,1,3] = [2,3,5] - T<sub>3</sub>[0,1,3] = [3,4,6] - T<sub>4</sub>[0,1,3] = [4,5,7] - T<sub>5</sub>[0,1,3] = [5,6,8] - T<sub>6</sub>[0,1,3] = [6,7,9] - T<sub>7</sub>[0,1,3] = [7,8,t] - T<sub>8</sub>[0,1,3] = [8,9,e] - T<sub>9</sub>[0,1,3] = [9,t,0] - T<sub>t</sub>[0,1,3] = [t,e,1] - T<sub>e</sub>[0,1,3] = [e,0,2]</p><p>There are a further twelve unique pc sets that result from inverting our prime form pc set. Of course, for each of these, you should normalize the pc set after inversion. - T<sub>0</sub>I[0,1,3] = [9,e,0] - T<sub>1</sub>I[0,1,3] = [t,0,1] - T<sub>2</sub>I[0,1,3] = [e,1,2] - T<sub>3</sub>I[0,1,3] = [0,2,3] - T<sub>4</sub>I[0,1,3] = [1,3,4] - T<sub>5</sub>I[0,1,3] = [2,4,5] - T<sub>6</sub>I[0,1,3] = [3,5,6] - T<sub>7</sub>I[0,1,3] = [4,6,7] - T<sub>8</sub>I[0,1,3] = [5,7,8] - T<sub>9</sub>I[0,1,3] = [6,8,9] - T<sub>t</sub>I[0,1,3] = [7,9,t] - T<sub>e</sub>I[0,1,3] = [8,t,e]</p><p>Each one of these twenty-four pc sets contains a unique collection of pitch classes.</p><h3 id="visually-representing-a-set-class">Visually representing a set class</h3><p>In the above example, you could describe T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>0</sub>I as the reverse order of the same <em>intervals</em> moving away from a central pitch. The only obvious correlation between the actual <em>pitch classes</em> is that both of the pc sets contain 0–which happens to be the interval of transposition for those two sets. (The interval of transposition is the “0” in T<sub>0</sub>.) If you look at each pair of transposed and inverted pc sets, you will notice the same thing; they always center the interval of transposition. If you wanted to represent this visually, you could plot each transposition and inversion on a chart, on which this central, shared pitch for each transposition shows the inversion and transposition branching out. Look at our trichords charted this way.</p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Inv pc set</th><th>inv pc 1</th><th>inv pc 2</th><th><strong>common pc</strong></th><th>tran pc 2</th><th>tran pc 3</th><th>Tran pc set</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>T<sub>0</sub>I</td><td>9</td><td>e</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>T<sub>0</sub></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>T<sub>1</sub>I</td><td>t</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>T<sub>1</sub></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>T<sub>2</sub>I</td><td>e</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>T<sub>2</sub></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>T<sub>3</sub>I</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>T<sub>3</sub></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>T<sub>4</sub>I</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>T<sub>4</sub></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>T<sub>1</sub>I</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>T<sub>5</sub></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>T<sub>6</sub>I</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>9</td><td>T<sub>6</sub></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>T<sub>7</sub>I</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>t</td><td>T<sub>7</sub></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>T<sub>8</sub>I</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>e</td><td>T<sub>8</sub></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>T<sub>9</sub>I</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>t</td><td>0</td><td>T<sub>9</sub></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>T<sub>t</sub>I</td><td>7</td><td>9</td><td>t</td><td>e</td><td>1</td><td>T<sub>t</sub></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>T<sub>e</sub>I</td><td>8</td><td>t</td><td>e</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>T<sub>e</sub></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Here, the “common pc” column shows the pitch class that is common to both the inversion and the transposition pc sets. (Note that to create this chart, the inverted form of the pc set is written in descending form rather than ascending form, so you must read it backwards to find its normal form.) You can make a chart like this for any pc set, and this would extremely helpful if you were analyzing a piece of music that had this trichord present. Rather than only looking for intervallic patterns, you could quickly refer to your chart to identify whether a specific trichord belongs to this set class. As you begin searching pieces for set classes, you will appreciate not having to transpose and invert every time; it is much easier to have a complete list for reference, and you could use our new (013) trichord “matrix” for this purpose.</p><h3 id="tone-rows-serialism-and-12-tone-music">Tone rows, serialism, and 12-tone music</h3><p>Before we go further, we should briefly define the genre of music most associated with set theory and matrices. (Although set theory can be used to study <em>any</em> type of music as long as it uses the twelve pitches from the chromatic scale.) <em>Serialism</em> is any music in which some aspect of the composition is based on a pre-defined repeatable pattern; this can be the melodic intervals, harmonic intervals, harmonies, rhythm, or any other aspect of music that could be described in a series.</p><p><em>12-tone music</em> is a sub-genre within serialism in which a fixed series of all twelve pitches is used to generate both the melodic and harmonic content of the piece. There are a variety of ways in which composers have employed this, but in its strictest form, all twelve pitches must be used before a pitch can be repeated. The series that determines the order of all twelve pitch classes is called a <em>tone row</em>; this will always be a listing of all twelve pitch classes with a fixed interval order. To provide compositional variety, the tone row may be altered to any of its transpositions or inversions, and any tone row may also be played in <em>retrograde</em> – all pitches in reverse order. So from this, there are four forms of a tone row. - Prime (P) - a tone row or any of its transpositions - Retrograde (R) - any <em>prime</em> row played in reverse order - Inversion (I) - the inversion of the original prime tone row and all its transpositions - Retrograde inversion (RI) - any inverted row played in reverse order</p><p>Because any of these tone row orders can start on all twelve pitches, there are forty-eight possible arrangements of any tone row: twelve prime tone rows, twelve inverted tone rows, twelve retrograde tone rows, and 12 retrograde inversion rows. We label these using the abbreviations P, R, I, and RI followed by a subscript number to represent the transposition. (e.g. P<sub>5</sub> or RI<sub>6</sub>).</p><h3 id="expanding-the-set">Expanding the set</h3><p>Now imagine that you were trying to create a visual representation for all forty-eight tone row possibilities in the same way we did above for the (013) trichord. You would have to create one of our charts for both the prime form and retrograde, and each row would twenty-three pitch classes in it. Luckily, there is a simpler, space efficient way to do this–a tone row matrix, so let’s set some ground rules. If you were to use the normal and/or prime form, there is technically only one form for an aggregate pitch set: (0123456789te). But for tone rows, we treat the intervallic pattern as a fixed part of the pc set–meaning we do <em>not</em> put the pc set into normal form. So you know, we can create nearly a million different distinct combinations of all twelve pitch classes if we fix the intervallic structure as well!</p><p>To illustrate this, try creating the first two lines of our twenty-three pitch class chart, T<sub>0</sub>/T<sub>0</sub>I and T<sub>1</sub>/T<sub>1</sub>I, for the following pc set: T<sub>0</sub> = (0,e,6,7,t,9,4,3,5,8,1,2)</p><p>Start by writing T<sub>0</sub>, and then write the inversion backwards from the first number. Then do the same for, T<sub>1</sub>.</p><h4 id="conclusion-24">Conclusion</h4><p>The answer to the pc set would take up too much screen for me to succinctly write in a table here, but I’ve written it in plain text.

Either is possible, but make sure that you are consistent in your application and clearly state which method you are using in any analysis.<ul><li>In fixed-zero, 0 will always be the pitch class that includes C.</li><li>In movable-zero, the analyst chooses a primary pitch to designate as 0 based on the important features of the piece (e.g. it is often the first pitch class of the piece) and then determines each other pitch class’s number based on the intervallic relationship to the designated 0 pitch class.</li></ul></li><li>In a tone row matrix, label each prime and inversion tone row by the abbreviation <code>P</code> or <code>I</code> respectively, followed by a subscript integer of the first pitch class for that row.</li><li>However, label retrograde (R) and retrograde inversion (RI) rows by their corresponding prime (P) and inversion (I) rows. If you don’t have a completed matrix available, but you know that a tone row is a R or RI form, you can just label it using the <strong>last</strong> pitch of the tone row, because that is the first pitch class of the corresponding P or I row. Therefore, R and RI rows are always labeled using their last pitch.</li><li>When building a matrix, there are two ways to arrange the prime and inversion tone rows of the matrix depending on which transposition of the tone row that you choose to place in the top level of the matrix.<ul><li>One possible layout prioritizes a specific iteration of the tone row by placing it in the top row of the matrix <em>in its non-transposed iteration</em>. Typically, your original tone row will be taken from a piece of music, so many theorists prefer to format the original row in the top position of the matrix. You must then determine each prime row based on this original row.<ul><li>For example, if the first iteration of the row started on A-flat, the first row in the matrix would be that row. If you are using fixed-zero notation this would be labeled P<sub>8</sub>, but if you are using movable-zero, this would be labeled P<sub>0</sub>.</li></ul></li><li>On the other hand, a matrix is meant to be a useful tool for composers and analysts, so it’s primary role is to help you track all possible uses of the row. It is easier to create a matrix that starts on 0, because creating the first inverted row (I<sub>0</sub>) can be created using your standard fixed-zero inversions. (i.e. 0 becomes 0, 1 becomes e, 2 becomes t, etc.) If using fixed-zero, though, it is rare that the piece will begin on pitch class 0 (C). Instead, you can simply transpose your entire tone row to start on 0, write this as the top left row of your matrix, and then create the matrix as we did above. Even though your rows will be in a different order, every row will be <em>labeled</em> identically to the other method because you are using fixed-zero notation.<ul><li>For example, if the first iteration of the row started on A-flat (pc 8 in fixed-zero), you would subtract 8 (or add 4) to transpose the entire row to begin on pitch class 0. You can then place this as the top row of your matrix and build the matrix normally. All rows will be labeled correctly according to fixed-zero notation. To make sure that you remember which row is the original row, you will probably want to mark it in some way. I do this by circling the row label (e.g. P<sub>8</sub>) of the row that begins the piece.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>When done correctly, any tone row matrix will have a pitch class that extends diagonally from the top left cell of the matrix to the bottom right cell. In the correct chart above, you can see that the pitch class 0 is in the first cell and then connects diagonally across the entire matrix.</li></ul><h4 id="common-mistakes">Common mistakes</h4><ul><li>The most common mistake when creating a matrix, other than simply mis-transposing, is the mislabeling of the tone rows. Remember that the labels for R and RI rows are based on their corresponding prime and inverted rows, NOT the starting pitch of the R or RI rows.</li><li>When using a matrix to analyze a 12-tone piece of music, you will occasionally encounter tone row <em>elision</em>. Two rows are said to be elighted if the ending pitch class(es) of of one row are actually shared to become the beginning pitch class(es) of the next row. If you encounter a tone row that seems to have less than twelve pitch classes, this is likely the reason.</li><li>If you use movable-zero, you will need to be careful in creating your first inverted row because you will not be inverting around C=0. Proponents of this method usually suggest inverting interval by interval away from the first pitch class. (e.g. If the first interval of the row is an <em>ascending</em> M3, then the first interval of your inverted row will be a <em>descending</em> M3. You will continue this process for each interval.)</li></ul><h3 id="technology-is-greatto-a-point">Technology is great…to a point</h3><p>As with most things, some enterprising people have created a shortcut to all of this work. There are now free-to-use matrix calculators such as the 12-tone assistant at <a href="http://in.music.sc.edu/fs/bain/software/tta-v2.4d/default.htm">this excellent website</a>. These are great to speed up your analysis, but as a student, make sure that you understand the principles of why and how these work before becoming entirely reliant on them. Even when trying to use this website, you must understand exactly what output you are trying to achieve before you can choose the correct option.</p><p>Admittedly, it is unlikely that you will ever be required to create a tone row matrix without access to a calculator (unless you are taking a music theory exam.) But the tedium of transposing each of the rows by hand will help you notice patterns in the tone row and help you to remember the nuances of the tone row as you analyze. This often provides insight into the analysis that would be missed by those relying on a calculator to create the matrix.</p><p>As discussed in the previous topics, scales represent a pitch collection, centered around a tonic pitch. Because we can transpose these pitch collections to center around any pitch-class, we create twelve unique pitch centers–called <em>keys</em>–and even more if we include enharmonic equivalents. Because writing accidentals for many of these keys would be clunky and difficult to read, we use a system of key signatures to give the performer a simple way of knowing which pitches in the key are raised and lowered.</p><h3 id="key-signatures">Key signatures</h3><p>Diatonic music is built around perfect intervals, although as we will see below, introducing one non-perfect interval to a series of perfect intervals creates the major scale and consequently diatonic tonality.

But for now, we can observe that one aspect of the overtone series, the circle-of-fifths, plays a critical role in defining diatonic function and key signatures. The order of sharps and flats follows a series of ascending perfect 5th intervals. - Order of sharps: F - C - G - D - A - E - B - Order of flats: B - E - A - D - G - C - F</p><p>Note that the two orders are simply reversed sequences of each other.</p><h4 id="tips-for-finding-major-key-signatures">Tips for finding major key signatures</h4><p>Your ultimate goal for key signatures should be the ability to instantly recall all key signatures from memory, but there are two common tricks that you can use to find the major key implied by any key signature.</p><ol type="1"><li>For any key signature with two or more flats, the name of the key is the <em>second to last flat</em> when reading from left to right. For example, in a key signature with four flats, the four flats from left to right are B-flat, E-flat, A-flat, and D-flat. The second to last flat is A-flat, so A-flat major is the implied major key of this key signature.</li><li>For any sharp key signature, you can go up a half-step (minor 2nd) from the last sharp to find the tonic of the implied major key. For example, in a key signature with four sharps, the sharps are F-sharp, C-sharp, G-sharp, and D-sharp when read from left to right. The last sharp is D-sharp and a minor 2nd above D-sharp is E-natural. So E major is the implied major key of this key signature.</li></ol><p>Of course, these tricks do not work for C major (no sharps or flats) or F major (one flat), but you should be able to remember those two keys.</p><h4 id="tips-for-finding-minor-key-signatures">Tips for finding minor key signatures</h4><p>You can combine the two tricks above with your knowledge of relative major and minor keys to quickly find the implied minor key of a key signature, because relative major and minor keys <em>share a key signature</em>. For example, if you know that a key signature of four sharps implies E major, you can go to the sixth scale degree of E major to find the tonic of the relative minor–in this case, C#. Therefore, E major and C-sharp minor both share a key signature of four sharps.</p><p>In diatonic harmony, second-inversion chords do not function in the same way as other inversions. Whereas root-position chords are stable, and first- and third-inversion chords create momentum by placing tendency tones in the bass, second-inversion chords are generally considered “weaker.” For example, listen to the following sonority repeatedly. It contains both a P4 and P5 above the a root. Because there is a dissonance between the upper two voices, you will likely hear this as wanting to resolve in some way. Isolate the voice that you would like to resolve and then figure out how you are naturally resolving it by singing it.</p><p>{% capture ex6 %}X:6 T:Perfect 4th versus perfect 5th M:4/4 L:1/2 Q:1/4=80 K:C V:1 [C2FG]| [C2FG]| [C2FG]|]{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“6” abc=ex6 %}</p><p>Most people will resolve this sonority as if it were a root position major triad that has a suspended third, although some might hear this as a minor triad instead.

In the above example that resolved the original sonority to an F major/minor chord, you can see how closely-related any key is to the key of its subdominant. Therefore, if used incorrectly, second-inversion chords can destabilize your part-writing by pushing toward a different key.</p><h3 id="tertiary-functions">Tertiary functions</h3><p>Because second-inversion triads are not as stable as the other inversions, they must be used differently in your part-writing. Instead of fulfilling a primary function such as tonic, dominant, or pre-dominant, they will have one of the four tertiary functions, one of which we already discussed in the previous unit: - cadential - passing - pedal - arpeggiated</p><p>For each of these functions, the chord will be extending the primary function of another chord rather than defining its own.</p><h3 id="doubling-1">Doubling</h3><p>As a general rule, 6/4 chords function best when the bass voice is doubled.

Look at the third progression that you just harmonized. If the cadential 6/4 were removed, it would create parallel perfect 5ths between the soprano and bass.</p><p>Some theory methods teach that a cadential 6/4 should not be labeled as a I<sup>6/4</sup>; instead, they label it as a V<sup>6/4 - 5/3</sup>. The reasoning behind this is twofold: - The I chord does not have a tonic function. - The cadential 6/4 chord resembles a 4-3 suspension and a 6-5 suspension occurring at the same time. These reasons ensure that students understand the true function of the cadential 6/4.</p><p>I prefer to label it as a I<sup>6/4</sup> chord, however, because: - We do not create special usage cases in our Roman numeral system for any other chord. It creates an unnecessary exception for students to learn and often confuses students. - By having two different chords labeled as a V<sup>6/4</sup>, it is easy for students to confuse a cadential 6/4 with an actual V<sup>6/4</sup>, a chord that occurs regularly as a passing chord. (Read more on this below under the <em>passing 6/4</em> section.) - When looking at an analysis, we are required to understand that almost every 6/4 chord has a tertiary function (i.e. passing, cadential, passing, and arpeggiated), but we do not create special Roman numeral cases for the other three types of tertiary functions. Students are more than capable of learning the other three usages of second inversion chords, and they can remember that a I<sup>6/4</sup> followed by a root-position V or V<sup>7</sup> chord is a cadential 6/4 and has a dominant function.</p><p>As with all tertiary function chords, it is helpful to label a chord when it is not functioning as a primary function. For example, if a strange chord is functioning as a passing chord, we do not simply label it with a Roman numeral, because a Roman numeral without an explanation assumes that the chord is functioning in its primary role. For tertiary functions, it is helpful to note somewhere in the analysis that it is functioning as a passing chord. It is helpful to apply the same strategy for cadential 6/4 chords, so I recommend bracketing the I<sup>6/4</sup> and V chord together and putting an abbreviated “cad” below the bracket.</p><h3 id="passing-64s">Passing 6/4s</h3><p>Passing chords are the second alternate function for second-inversion chords, and they function identically to our description of how <a href="11-further-part-writing/b1-voiceleading1stand3rdinv.html">first- and third-inversion chords are used as passing chords</a>–a chord inserted between two other chords to create a bass line with stepwise motion. As before, <em>passing</em> is a function that replaces a chord’s primary function, and instead extends the function of the chords on either side.

When a chord resolves against the normal flow of a circle-of-fifths flowchart (see <a href="07-harmonic-functions/a1-diaprogcirclefifths.html">Unit 7a</a>), we call that a <em>regression</em>. In the example above, the first V chord <em>should</em> resolve to a tonic chord but instead regresses to a ii chord. This works because of the strength of the bass line, so it is the <em>passing function</em> that extends the dominant harmony through a stepwise bass line.**</p><h3 id="function-over-form-part-4">Function over form (Part 4)</h3><p>Now that we have practiced using a passing 6/4 chord, we can also clarify why vii<sup>o6</sup> chords function well as a passing chord. When studying first inversion chords [Unit 11b]](11-further-part-writing/b1-voiceleading1stand3rdinv.html), we discussed two important ideas regarding vii<sup>o</sup> chords: - The vii<sup>o</sup> is a functional substitution for the V<sup>7</sup> chord and therefore takes its voice-leading and doubling conventions from the V<sup>7</sup> chord. - The vii<sup>o6</sup> is often employed as a passing chord between I and I<sup>6</sup> to create a bass line with stepwise motion.</p><p>This explains why a vii<sup>o6</sup> chord functions as a passing chord; it is actually a functional substitution for a passing V<sup>6/4</sup> chord.

A pedal 6/4 occurs when a voice remains static across multiple chords by employing a second inversion chord. <em>Note that this is different from a non-chord tone pedal</em>, because a pedal 6/4 chord uses only chord tones to create the static pedal; it does not use non-chord tones to create the pedal.

Depending on the harmonic rhythm of the piece, an arpeggiated chord may be viewed as either a melodic bass line that does not change inversion or an entirely new instance of the chord in a different inversion.</p><p>Your decision should ultimately reflect how you hear the piece. If you have a repeated harmony but each reiteration of the harmony sounds like a new phrase or statement, then you should label each inversion of the chord according to its bass note. On the other hand, if it sounds like one continuous harmony, particularly if a melody and phrasing implies this, then you do not need to mark every inversion of the chord.</p><p>Regardless, you should label the chord’s inversion by the <em>strongest</em> note in the bass. This will often be the lowest note in the arpeggiation, but your perception can shift depending on the order in which you hear the arpeggiation as well as which pitches are in the strongest metric position.

It ends up looking like a big square.</p><p><strong>Developing a matrix</strong> - When we construct a matrix, we write the original row across the top (horizontally) and its inversion down the side (vertically). This only works when your row begins with 0 (since 0’s inversion is 0), so if you start your row with a first number other than 0, zero it out and use that one for your top row instead - Once you have these two, you can transpose for each horizontal line going off of the first digits provided in the inversion/first veritcal column. The lines represent transpositions, and the columns are inversions - You can check yourself by making sure that you have 0’s in a diagonal across the middle from the upper left corner to the bottom right corner - The subscript numbers will always match for P/R and I/RI. Retrograde and retrograde inversion labels <em>must</em> match the prime and inversion labels so that we know what they are a retrograde <em>of</em>. So, R and RI rows will have subscripts that don’t match the number they start with.</p><p>The primary purpose for a tone row matrix is to use it as a point of reference to analyze 12-tone music.

Perhaps even more importantly for our discussions, we can study the acoustics–or the math–behind this overtone series to explain the fundamentals of Western harmony.</p><p>The overtone series can help you to understand: - why we divide the octave into twelve parts. - why we hear some intervals as consonant and others as dissonant. - how we determine if an interval is in tune. - why we use a harmonic system based on perfect intervals and thirds.</p><h3 id="the-structure-of-the-overtone-series">The Structure of the Overtone Series</h3><p>The overtone series is a series of intervals, or a <em>harmonic series</em>, above a given pitch. We call the lowest pitch the <em>fundamental</em>, and every tone above it is considered an <em>overtone</em>. In the example below, <code>C2</code> is the fundamental, <code>C3</code> is the first overtone, <code>G3</code> is the second overtone, and so on.</p><p>You may also describe the tones of the overtone series by labeling each overtone as a <em>partial</em>. In this system, the fundamental is considered equal to all other tones, so it is labeled as the first partial. In the example below, <code>C2</code> is the first partial, <code>C3</code> is the second partial, <code>G3</code> is the third partial, and so on.</p><p>For the example below, determine the numbering for each of these notes as both overtones and partials. Then practice transposing the entire series to other pitches.</p><p>{% capture ex1 %}X:1 T:The overtone series M:2/2 L:1/2 K:C V:1 x x x x E G _B c d e ^f g|] V:2 clef=bass C,,C,G,C x x x x x x x x|]{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“1” abc=ex1 %}</p><h3 id="bernstein-on-the-importance-of-the-overtone-series">Bernstein on the importance of the overtone series</h3><p>Next, please watch this wonderful video of Leonard Bernstein explaining how the overtone series explains harmony’s evolution throughout the ages.

When the frequency of a soundwave doubles, our brains hear those two frequencies as sharing some fundamental commonality, so it interprets those two pitches as the “same” but separated by an octave. Therefore, octaves always have a 2:1 ratio. (A110, A220, A440, and A880 are all <code>A</code> separated by octaves.) The next two simplest ratios ares a 3:2 ratio and a 4:3 ratio, which create a perfect 5th and a perfect 4th respectively.</p><p>The importance of these ratios is most easily observed in the circle of fifths. If you begin on any pitch-class and begin moving by ascending perfect 5ths (or 4ths), you will find yourself back at the beginning after cycling through all twelve pitch-classes. We call this the circle of fifths.</p><p>C - G - D - A - E - B - F-sharp - C-sharp - G-sharp - D-sharp/E-flat - B-flat - F - <em>C</em></p><p>Perhaps more important for our discussion, though, is what happens when we introduce a diminished 5th into the pattern. Try this quick exercise: 1. Choose any starting pitch, and then write your starting pitch and the next six pitches from the circle of fifths on a separate piece of paper. - If you’ve done this correctly, you should have one pitch for every letter name. e.g. one ‘A,’ one ‘B,’ etc. 2. Choose any pitch within your seven pitches, and lower it by one half-step thus creating the interval of a diminished 5th between it and the previous pitch. 3. We will consider the two pitches of this diminished 5th to be our starting interval. Starting with the first pitch after your interval, begin altering the pitches to create perfect 5ths based on your altered note. - For example, if you chose to alter A to A-flat, you would have created a diminished 5th between D and A-flat. You will then lower all pitches after A-flat to create perfect 5ths again, starting by lowering E to E-flat. 4. Continue lowering pitches (and creating perfect 5ths) through the circle of fifths until you wrap around to your original interval. - If you started by altering A, you created a diminished 5th between D and A-flat. You will then lower every pitch until you get back to D, but leave D unaltered. In this example, you would end with: D - <em>A-flat</em> - E-flat - B-flat - F - C - G 5. If you re-arrange the seven pitches that you’ve created, you will notice that you have created a diatonic collection of seven pitches. - Continuing our example that we started by altering A to A-flat, you can see that we have three flat notes, and if you use your knowledge of key signatures, you know that the major scale with three flats starts on the tonic of E-flat. If you re-arrange these pitches, you will see: E-flat - F - G - A-flat - B-flat - C - D</p><p>This slight change–the addition of one diminished 5th–creates the necessary tension for keys to function diatonically, so diatonic function could be described as a slight imperfection on an otherwise perfect series of intervals.</p><p>This can be further shown by looking at the naturally occuring intervals if we write diatonic 5ths above the notes of a major scale.</p><p>{% capture ex2 %}X:2 %%staffsep 100% T:Diatonic 5ths in the Major Scale M:C L:1/2 K:C [CG] [DA]| [EB] [Fc]| [Gd] [Ae]| [Bf] [cg]|| w:P5 P5 P5 P5 P5 P5 d5 P5{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“2” abc=ex2 %}</p><p>Because we explored harmonic function in Unit 6, the tension provided by the one non-perfect 5th and its subsequent release should now be obvious.</p><p>Key signatures reflect the importance of the one non-perfect interval. When studying the consecutive key signatures, you should focus on <em>which scale degree</em> is changed between consecutive keys. - When a sharp is added to a key, it always raises the 7th scale degree in the new key, thereby creating the new <code>ti</code>. - When a flat is added to a key, it always lowers the 4th scale degree in the new key, thereby creating the new <code>fa</code>.</p><h4 id="order-of-sharps-and-flats">Order of sharps and flats</h4><p>This directly reflects how diatonic function works; if we change <em>where</em> the one non-perfect 5th occurs, we change the key. We did not need to spend time determining the order of sharps and flats, because the class was already familiar with this from previous courses. It did not surprise them that circle-of-fifths plays a critical role in defining diatonic function and key signatures. The two orders are simply the reverses of each other. - Order of sharps: F - C - G - D - A - E - B - Order of flats: B - E - A - D - G - C - F</p><h3 id="conclusions-71">Conclusions</h3><p>The <em>overtone series</em>, often referred to as the <em>harmonic series</em>, is a series of intervals built off of a pitch. There are two ways to label the overtone series. - Label the the first pitch of an overtone series the <strong>fundamental</strong> and every pitch above it is then numbered as an <strong>overtone</strong>. - Fundamental, 1st overtone, 2nd overtone, etc. - Label each pitch as a numbered <strong>partial</strong>. - 1st partial, 2nd partial, 3rd partial, etc.</p><p>The overtone series built off of <code>C2</code> would be:</p><p>{% capture ex3 %}X:3 T:The overtone series T:Labeled as a fundamental with numbered overtones M:2/2 L:1/2 K:C V:1 x x x x E G <em>B c d e ^f g|] w: </em> _ _ _ 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 10th 11th V:2 clef=bass C,,C,G,C x x x x x x x x|] w:fund. 1st 2nd 3rd{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“3” abc=ex3 %}</p><p>{% capture ex4 %}X:4 T:The overtone series T:Labeled as partials M:2/2 L:1/2 K:C V:1 x x x x E G <em>B c d e ^f g|] w: </em> _ _ _ 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 10th 11th 12th V:2 clef=bass C,,C,G,C x x x x x x x x|] w:1st 2nd 3rd 4th{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“4” abc=ex4 %}</p><p>The overtone series occurs naturally and can be explained mathematically, so it is one of the few objective ways in which we can discuss the origin of music. Any interval can be viewed as a ratio comparing the frequncies of the two pitches that create the interval. The simplest ratio, other than 1:1, is 2:1. For example, <code>C2</code> has a frequency of about 65.4 hertz (hz = vibrations per second), and <code>C3</code> has a frequency of about 130.8: a ratio of 2:1. When we hear two frequencies that have a 2:1 ratio, our brains interpret this as “the same pitch separated by an octave” – an elegant solution to interpreting a physical phenomenon. This example demonstrates that all concepts associated with music, such as pitches, dividing octaves, intonation, etc., are human creations trying to organize and interpret the physical phenomenon of soundwaves entering our ear.</p><p>The overtone series orders intervals by decreasing size but increasing complexity. The first interval of the overtone series, a P8, is the “simplest” interval of 2:1. As the overtone series moves upward, each interval becomes smaller but more complex. A P5 has a ratio of 3:2, a P4 has a ratio of 4:3, a M3 has a ratio of 5:4, and onward.</p><h3 id="concepts-derived-from-the-overtone-series">Concepts derived from the overtone series</h3><p>The overtone series is notable because: - The overtone series is present above every note played by a standard musical instrument or the human voice. - When a person sings a pitch, we hear the fundamental as the pitch name, but the strength of each overtone above that fundamental determines many qualities that we associate with the pitch such as timbre. - The overtone series is the basis for intonation. - Using the ratios from the overtone series, we can determine what is “in tune.” For example, an octave is a frequency that is exactly twice as high as the given pitch, and a true P5 is a frequency that is 1.5 times higher than the given pitch. - Fixed pitch instruments (e.g. piano) use a system of <em>equal temperament</em> to play in all twelve keys without having to re-tune the instrument every time the key changes. This means that we intentionally tune these instruments “out of tune” when compared to the overtone series ratios, because being always slightly out-of-tune is a far better compromise than being perfectly in-tune sometimes and grossly out-of-tune at others. - The overtone series defines why the octave is divided into 12 parts, because it is from the overtone series that we derive the circle-of-fifths. Please refer to the discussion of the circle-of-fifths and tonality in Lesson 2c. - The overtone series provides a visual example of why we find certain intervals more consonant or dissonant. - We hear simpler ratios of intervals as consonant and complex ratios as dissonant. So intervals at the beginning of the overtone series represent consonant intervals, but as the intervals decrease in size as the overtone series moves upward, the ratios become more complex and therefore more dissonant. - The overtone series provides a good foundation for voicing chords. - Idealized voicing for chords often mimic the overtone series by placing each voice along the overtone series of the lowest voice.</p><h4 id="remembering-the-overtone-series">Remembering the overtone series</h4><p>There are many ways to remember the overtone series. - The first is to remember the intervals. This is easy at the beginning of the series, but becomes repetitive and easy to mess up as the series ascends. - P8-P5-P4-M3-m3-m3-M2-M2-M2-M2-m2. - You can also think of them as a sequence of scale degrees above the fundamental. - 1 - 1 - 5 - 1 - 3 - 5 - b7 - 1 - 2 - 3 - #4 - 5 - And for some, it is easier to divide the series into groupings. For example, when looking at the first 12 partials - The first four pitches are a tripled fundamental and one fifth. - The second set of four pitches is a first inversion dominant triad built off of the fundamental. - The final three pitches represent <code>re-mi-fi-sol</code> or the beginning of the Lydian mode of the fundamental.</p><p>When looking at this final method for remembering the first 12 pitches of the overtone series, I find it fascinating that each group of four pitches implies a different key area: - The first four pitches strongly imply a key that uses the fundamental as tonic. - The next 4 partials imply a key with a tonic based on the <em>subdominant</em> of the fundamental, because the dominant seventh chord would be a V chord in the key of the subdominant. - The third set of four paritals imply a key with a tonic based on the <em>dominant</em> of the fundamental as demonstrated by thinking of this pattern as <code>sol-la-ti-do</code> in the key of the dominant.</p><h4 id="from-end-of-key-signature-topic">FROM END OF KEY SIGNATURE TOPIC</h4><p><strong>INCORPORATE INTO MATERIAL ABOVE now that we’ve moved this out of its own unit</strong></p><p>The division of the octave into twelve parts is our brains’ interpretations of a simple mathematical phenomenon.

The next two simplest ratios are a 3:2 ratio and a 4:3 ratio, which create a perfect 5th and a perfect 4th respectively.</p><p>Not only does your brain’s interpretation of these ratios create the ideas of consonance and dissonance, it is also the reason we divide the octave into twelve instead of a “simpler” number such as ten. You can observe this effect most easily in the circle of fifths. If you begin on any pitch-class and begin moving by ascending perfect 5ths (or 4ths), you will find yourself back at the beginning after cycling through all twelve pitch-classes. We call this the circle of fifths.</p><p>C - G - D - A - E - B - F-sharp - C-sharp - G-sharp - D-sharp/E-flat - B-flat - F - <em>C</em></p><p>Perhaps more important for our discussion, though, is what happens when we introduce a non-perfect 5th into the pattern. If we begin on a pitch-class and begin moving through ascending perfect 5ths, each new perfect 5th will move us to a <em>new letter</em>. After the first six letters, we begin adding accidentals and then repeating letters as seen in the circle of fifths above. If, however, we alter the last perfect 5th by a half-step to create a diminished 5th, we can break the pattern and shortcut to the end with one final perfect 5th.</p><p>C (P5) G (P5) D (P5) A (P5) E (P5) B (d5) <em>F</em> (P5) C</p><p>This slight change creates the necessary tension for keys to function diatonically, so diatonic function could be described as a slight imperfection on an otherwise perfect series of intervals.</p><p>This can be further shown by looking at the naturally occurring intervals when we write diatonic 5ths above the notes of a major scale.</p><p>{% capture ex7 %}X:7 %%staffsep 100% T:Diatonic 5ths in the Major Scale M:C L:1/2 K:C [CG] [DA]| [EB] [Fc]| [Gd] [Ae]| [Bf] [cg]|| w:P5 P5 P5 P5 P5 P5 d5 P5{% endcapture %} {% include abc-example.html number=“7” abc=ex7 %}</p><p>When we begin exploring harmonic function in Unit 6, the tension provided by the one non-perfect 5th and its subsequent release will become obvious.</p><p>Key signatures reflect the importance of the one non-perfect interval.

This will likely lead to two basic principles: - When a sharp is added to a key, it always raises the 7th scale degree in the new key, thereby creating the new <code>ti</code>. - You can find the new <code>do</code> by going up a half-step from the new <code>ti</code>. - When a flat is added to a key, it always lowers the 4th scale degree in the new key, thereby creating the new <code>fa</code>. - You can find the new <code>do</code> by going down a P4 (or up a P5) from the new <code>fa</code>.</p><h4 id="order-of-sharps-and-flats-1">Order of sharps and flats</h4><p>This directly reflects how diatonic function works; if we change <em>where</em> the one non-perfect 5th occurs, we change the key.
